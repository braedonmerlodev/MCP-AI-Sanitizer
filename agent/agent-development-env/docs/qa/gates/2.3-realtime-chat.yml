decision: PASS
rationale: |
  The real-time chat implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with robust error handling, security integration, and offline support. Risk assessment shows low-medium risk with effective mitigations in place. Quality attributes are satisfied, and the implementation demonstrates good testability and maintainability.
concerns: |
  - Additional end-to-end test coverage for WebSocket edge cases and reconnection scenarios
  - Performance testing under high concurrent load
  - Security audit for WebSocket protocol vulnerabilities
recommendations: |
  - Implement comprehensive e2e tests covering offline queuing, reconnection, and cross-browser compatibility
  - Add load testing for multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
  - Consider implementing message encryption for sensitive chat content
  - Extract magic numbers (reconnection intervals, heartbeat timing) to configuration
