decision: CONCERNS
rationale: The story demonstrates strong technical planning with comprehensive acceptance criteria, detailed implementation notes, and good error handling. Requirements are well-traceable to test scenarios. Risk assessment identifies key concerns around security and reliability that are appropriately mitigated. However, the deferral of resumable uploads introduces reliability risks for large files in unstable networks, and backend security validation needs explicit confirmation.
concerns:
  - Resumable uploads are deferred, potentially impacting user experience for large files
  - Need confirmation that backend MCP Security Agent sanitization tools are implemented and effective
  - Large file handling (10MB) should be validated in performance testing
recommendations:
  - Prioritize resumable upload implementation in next sprint
  - Conduct security testing with actual malicious PDF samples
  - Add performance benchmarks for upload times
