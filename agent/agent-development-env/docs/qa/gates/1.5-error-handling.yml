decision: PASS
rationale: |
  The error handling implementation is comprehensive, well-tested, and production-ready. All core acceptance criteria are met with robust error recovery mechanisms. The risk profile shows low-to-medium risks with effective mitigations in place. Test coverage is excellent across all levels. Minor gaps in performance measurement and accessibility testing should be addressed in future iterations but do not block deployment.
