reviewed_by: 'Quinn (Test Architect)'
gate: 'CONCERNS'
rationale: 'Critical authentication feature partially implemented. Storage encryption complete but UI, error handling, and environment config missing. High security risk due to incomplete implementation. Requires completion of Tasks 3-5 before production deployment.'
risk_profile: 'HIGH'
nfr_assessment: 'Security and reliability requirements partially met - encryption strong but error handling and usability incomplete'
recommendations:
  - 'Implement UI components for key management (Task 3)'
  - 'Add authentication error handling in API client (Task 4)'
  - 'Implement environment-specific configuration (Task 5)'
  - 'Consider migrating from localStorage to more secure storage'
  - 'Add comprehensive test suite'
  - 'Security audit of complete auth flow'
