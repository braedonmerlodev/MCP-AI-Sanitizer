# Story: Implement Integration Testing for API Interactions

## User Story

As a QA engineer, I want integration tests so that I can verify that the frontend properly integrates with backend services and external APIs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API integration tests with mocked responses
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] File upload integration testing
- [ ] Real-time communication testing
- [ ] Error handling integration tests
- [ ] State management integration tests
- [ ] Component integration testing

## Technical Details

- Set up integration test environment
- Configure API mocking (MSW or similar)
- Implement tests for complete user flows
- Add tests for error scenarios
- Test state management across components
- Implement contract testing with backend
- Set up integration test data management

## Definition of Done

- All API integrations are tested
- Integration tests run reliably
- Mock data accurately represents real responses
- Error scenarios are properly tested
- Integration issues are caught early
