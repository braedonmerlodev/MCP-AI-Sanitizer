# Story: Implement End-to-End Testing with Cypress

## User Story

As a user, I want the application to work end-to-end so that I can be confident that complete workflows function correctly in a real browser environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cypress E2E test suite configured
- [ ] Critical user flows tested (upload, chat, processing)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing setup
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] API mocking for E2E tests
- [ ] Test data management
- [ ] CI/CD integration for E2E tests

## Technical Details

- Configure Cypress with proper test structure
- Implement page object model for maintainability
- Set up test data factories
- Configure API mocking for E2E scenarios
- Add visual testing capabilities
- Implement cross-browser testing
- Set up parallel test execution

## Definition of Done

- All critical user flows are tested E2E
- Tests run in multiple browsers
- E2E tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Test failures provide clear debugging information
- Test maintenance is manageable
