# Story: Implement Performance Metrics Collection

## User Story

As a performance engineer, I want comprehensive performance metrics so that I can monitor application speed and identify optimization opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Page load time tracking
- [ ] API response time monitoring
- [ ] Core Web Vitals measurement
- [ ] User interaction performance tracking
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Real user monitoring (RUM)
- [ ] Performance alerting thresholds

## Technical Details

- Implement performance monitoring SDK
- Configure Core Web Vitals tracking
- Set up custom performance metrics
- Add user timing API integration
- Configure performance budgets
- Implement automated performance regression testing
- Set up performance alerting

## Definition of Done

- All key performance metrics are tracked
- Performance regressions are detected automatically
- Core Web Vitals are monitored
- Performance data drives optimization decisions
- Performance alerts work correctly
