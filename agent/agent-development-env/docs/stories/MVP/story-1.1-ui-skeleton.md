# Story: UI Skeleton and CI/CD Setup

## User Story

As a developer, I want to set up the basic UI skeleton with layout components and CI/CD pipeline so that I have a foundation for building the chat interface features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Basic layout created with Header, Main Content Area, and Footer
- [ ] UI component library integrated (Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured for automated build, linting, and testing
- [ ] Responsive layout structure implemented
- [ ] Component library properly configured and themed
- [ ] Build pipeline passes all checks
- [ ] Automated deployment setup (if applicable)

## Technical Details

- Implement basic layout using the chosen component library
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions or similar
- Configure automated testing and linting in pipeline
- Ensure responsive design patterns are established
- Set up theme configuration for consistent styling

## Definition of Done

- Layout renders correctly across breakpoints
- CI/CD pipeline runs successfully on commits
- Component library components are importable and functional
- Code follows established patterns and passes linting

## Story Points: 5

## Dependencies

- Technical project setup (Story 1.1) must be completed first

## Notes

This story completes the project foundation by adding the UI skeleton and automation. Together with Story 1.1 Technical Setup, they fulfill the PRD's Story 1.1 requirements.
