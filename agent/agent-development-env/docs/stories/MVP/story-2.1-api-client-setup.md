# Story: Set Up API Client and Base Integration

## User Story

As a developer, I want a robust API client setup so that I can reliably communicate with the MCP Security Agent backend services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API client library configured (Axios/Fetch)
- [ ] Base URL and environment configuration
- [ ] Request/response interceptors implemented
- [ ] Common headers and authentication setup
- [ ] Error handling for network failures
- [ ] Request timeout configuration
- [ ] API response type definitions

## Technical Details

- Choose and configure HTTP client library
- Set up environment-specific API endpoints
- Implement request/response interceptors for logging and error handling
- Create TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Add request timeout and retry configurations
- Set up base headers for content-type and authentication

## Definition of Done

- API client can make successful requests to backend
- Error responses are properly handled
- TypeScript types prevent runtime errors
- Configuration works across different environments
