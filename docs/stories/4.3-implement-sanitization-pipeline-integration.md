# Story 4.3: Implement Sanitization Pipeline Integration

## User Story

As a security officer, I want all Markdown content to be automatically sanitized through the existing API, so that malicious content is neutralized before document storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Markdown content is sent to `/api/sanitize` endpoint for processing.
2. Sanitization results are captured and validated for successful completion.
3. Failed sanitization attempts are logged and flagged for manual review.
4. Sanitization metadata is recorded (processing time, changes made, warnings issued).
5. Integration handles API errors gracefully with exponential backoff retry logic.
6. Performance monitoring tracks sanitization latency and success rates.
7. Complete audit trail maintains processing history for compliance.

## Implementation Notes

- Integrate with existing `/api/sanitize` endpoint
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Track performance metrics
- Handle API failures gracefully

## Dependencies

- Existing sanitization API (already implemented)
- Retry logic library (optional)
- Logging enhancements
- Performance monitoring utilities

## Status

‚è≥ **PENDING** - Ready for development (depends on Story 4.2)
