# Story 9.4: Enable High-Fidelity Data Collection

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,  
**I want** to implement comprehensive data gathering infrastructure to support future AI risk assessment capabilities,  
**so that** we collect high-quality training data for machine learning models with complete context and metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Data collection captures complete risk assessment context including input data, processing steps, and decision outcomes
2. Training data format is optimized for AI model consumption with structured features and labels
3. Data quality validation ensures completeness and accuracy for AI training
4. Collection infrastructure supports scalable data gathering without performance degradation
5. Data export capabilities enable seamless integration with AI training pipelines
