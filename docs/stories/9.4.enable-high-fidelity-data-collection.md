# Story 9.4: Enable High-Fidelity Data Collection

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,  
**I want** to implement comprehensive data gathering infrastructure to support future AI risk assessment capabilities,  
**so that** we collect high-quality training data for machine learning models with complete context and metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Data collection captures complete risk assessment context including input data, processing steps, and decision outcomes
2. Training data format is optimized for AI model consumption with structured features and labels
3. Data quality validation ensures completeness and accuracy for AI training
4. Collection infrastructure supports scalable data gathering without performance degradation
5. Data export capabilities enable seamless integration with AI training pipelines

## Dependencies

- Story 9.2: Enhance Audit Trail for High-Risk Cases (docs/stories/9.2.enhance-audit-trail-for-high-risk-cases.md - Status: Done) - Provides ML-optimized audit fields (threatPatternId, confidenceScore, featureVector, trainingLabels) and specialized logging for High-Level/Unknown Risk cases

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design high-fidelity data collection schema for AI training (AC #2)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive context capture in risk assessments (AC #1)
- [ ] Add data quality validation for training data completeness (AC #3)
- [ ] Integrate structured feature extraction for ML models (AC #2)
- [ ] Implement data export capabilities for AI pipelines (AC #4, #5)
- [ ] Add unit tests for data collection and validation (AC #1-5)
- [ ] Add integration tests for data export functionality (AC #4, #5)
- [ ] Update documentation for data collection infrastructure (AC #1-5)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info

- **Data Collection Integration**: Extend audit logging with AI training data fields - see docs/architecture/components.md
- **Data Models**: Enhance models for comprehensive context capture - see docs/architecture/data-models.md
- **Export Capabilities**: Add data export endpoints or utilities - see docs/architecture/external-apis.md
- **Technology Stack**: Use existing Node.js/Express for APIs, SQLCipher for secure data storage - see docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
- **Data Export Formats**: JSON for structured data, CSV for tabular features, Parquet for ML training datasets
- **ML Integration**: Feature extraction compatible with scikit-learn or TensorFlow formats
- **Assumptions**: Data volume suitable for in-memory processing, existing audit infrastructure handles load, PII redaction from Story 9.1 applies
- **Edge Cases**: Handle corrupted input data, incomplete risk assessment records, export failures, large dataset scalability

## Security Considerations

- **PII Handling**: Training data must maintain PII redaction from audit logs, anonymize sensitive features
- **Data Privacy**: Export capabilities should include access controls and audit logging
- **Data Integrity**: Training datasets must be tamper-proof with cryptographic verification
- **Export Security**: Secure data export with encryption and access logging

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Validate data collection completeness and structure
- **Integration Tests**: Test data export and AI pipeline integration
- **Data Quality Tests**: Verify training data meets AI model requirements
- **Performance Tests**: Validate scalable data gathering without >5% performance impact
- **Data Validation Tests**: Ensure feature completeness, label accuracy, and export format integrity

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Data collection validation and structure verification
- **Integration Tests**: Data export functionality and pipeline integration
- **Quality Tests**: Training data completeness and AI model compatibility
