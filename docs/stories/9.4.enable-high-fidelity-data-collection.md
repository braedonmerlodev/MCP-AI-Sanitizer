# Story 9.4: Enable High-Fidelity Data Collection

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info

- **Data Collection Integration**: Extend audit logging with AI training data fields - see docs/architecture/components.md
- **Data Models**: Enhance models for comprehensive context capture - see docs/architecture/data-models.md
- **Export Capabilities**: Add data export endpoints or utilities - see docs/architecture/external-apis.md
- **Technology Stack**: Use existing Node.js/Express for APIs, SQLCipher for secure data storage - see docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
- **Data Export Formats**: JSON for structured data, CSV for tabular features, Parquet for ML training datasets
- **ML Integration**: Feature extraction compatible with scikit-learn or TensorFlow formats
- **Assumptions**: Data volume suitable for in-memory processing, existing audit infrastructure handles load, PII redaction from Story 9.1 applies
- **Edge Cases**: Handle corrupted input data, incomplete risk assessment records, export failures, large dataset scalability

## Security Considerations

- **PII Handling**: Training data must maintain PII redaction from audit logs, anonymize sensitive features
- **Data Privacy**: Export capabilities should include access controls and audit logging
- **Data Integrity**: Training datasets must be tamper-proof with cryptographic verification
- **Export Security**: Secure data export with encryption and access logging

### Testing Standards
