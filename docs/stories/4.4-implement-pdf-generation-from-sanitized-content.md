# Story 4.4: Implement PDF Generation from Sanitized Content

## User Story

As a document manager, I want sanitized Markdown content to be converted into clean, validated PDF documents, so that a verified document library is maintained for secure access.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. PDFKit library generates new PDFs from sanitized Markdown content.
2. Clean PDFs maintain document structure, formatting, and readability.
3. Watermark or metadata clearly indicates document has been sanitized and verified.
4. File naming convention distinguishes sanitized documents from raw uploads.
5. Storage system organizes clean documents in separate, secure location.
6. PDF generation handles various content types, lengths, and complexities.
7. Quality validation ensures generated PDFs are readable, complete, and properly formatted.
