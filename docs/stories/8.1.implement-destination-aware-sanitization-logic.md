# Story 8.1: Implement Destination-Aware Sanitization Logic

## Status

Changes Required

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,  
**I want** to implement destination-aware sanitization logic in the MCP traffic proxy,  
**so that** the system can detect MCP traffic destinations and apply appropriate sanitization levels based on risk assessment, optimizing performance while maintaining comprehensive security.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The proxy can accurately detect the destination of incoming MCP traffic (e.g., LLM endpoint, external tool API, internal operation).
2. High-risk destinations (LLMs and external tools) receive full bidirectional sanitization through the complete pipeline (normalization, stripping, neutralization, redaction).
3. Low-risk destinations (internal file operations, local tool calls) receive optimized processing with lightweight validation while maintaining security standards.
4. The system defaults to full sanitization when destination risk cannot be determined or classified.
5. Bidirectional sanitization is preserved for all traffic types - both requests and responses are processed according to destination risk.
6. Destination detection and applied sanitization level are logged in audit trails for compliance and debugging.
7. Configuration allows administrators to adjust risk classifications and sanitization levels without code changes.
8. Performance metrics show maintained latency (<100ms) with selective processing optimization.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info

- **ProxySanitizer.js**: Main entry point in `src/components/ProxySanitizer.js` - modify to add destination detection before routing to pipeline
- **SanitizationPipeline.js**: Core pipeline in `src/components/SanitizationPipeline.js` - update to accept and use sanitization level parameter
- **SanitizationEvent.js**: Data model in `src/models/SanitizationEvent.js` - extend to include destination and sanitization level fields
- **AuditLogger.js**: Logging component in `src/components/AuditLogger.js` - update to capture new audit fields
- **api.js**: Routes in `src/routes/api.js` - ensure API endpoints support selective processing without breaking changes

### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `src/tests/unit/` for unit tests, `src/tests/integration/` for integration tests
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest 29.7.0 for unit testing, with mocking for external dependencies
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% for destination detection and risk assessment logic, 80% overall
- **Test Patterns**: AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert), mock all external dependencies
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline testing with mocked destinations, validate bidirectional flow
- **Performance Testing**: Include latency measurements for different sanitization levels

### Key Technical Details

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js 20.11.0, Express.js 4.18.2 for API handling
- **Architecture Patterns**: Extend Proxy Pattern with destination-aware routing, maintain Pipeline Pattern for sanitization
- **Security Requirements**: All traffic maintains minimum security standards, high-risk destinations get comprehensive protection
- **Performance Goals**: Maintain <100ms latency, optimize processing for low-risk traffic
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables or config files for risk mappings, avoid hardcoding
- **Error Handling**: Follow Winston 3.11.0 logging standards, custom error classes for destination detection failures
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing full sanitization behavior as default/fallback

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation shows good architectural decisions with conditional sanitization logic in the SanitizationPipeline and destination tracking middleware. The code is well-structured with proper separation of concerns. However, several key features from the acceptance criteria are not yet implemented, including bidirectional sanitization, destination-aware audit logging, configurable risk mappings, and performance metrics tracking.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the existing code quality is acceptable and changes would require completing the missing features first.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ - Code follows established patterns and conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ - Components are properly organized
- Testing Strategy: ✓ - Unit and integration tests exist for implemented features
- All ACs Met: ✗ - ACs 5, 6, 7, 8 are not fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Implement bidirectional sanitization for responses (AC5)
- [ ] Add destination and sanitization level to audit logging (AC6)
- [ ] Create configuration schema for risk level mappings (AC7)
- [ ] Add performance metrics tracking for latency measurements (AC8)
- [ ] Update SanitizationEvent model to include destination fields
- [ ] Extend audit logging in AuditLogger to capture destination metadata
- [ ] Add configuration loading for risk classifications
- [ ] Implement response sanitization in proxy handlers

### Security Review

The security implementation is sound for the implemented features. The default-to-full-sanitization approach for unclear destinations provides good security defaults. However, the lack of bidirectional sanitization means response data may not be protected consistently.

### Performance Considerations

The conditional bypass for non-LLM traffic should improve performance, but without metrics tracking (AC8), this cannot be validated. The implementation looks efficient for the current scope.

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural foundations with destination detection middleware, conditional sanitization logic, and comprehensive test coverage for implemented features. The code quality is high with proper error handling and security defaults. However, critical gaps remain in bidirectional sanitization, audit logging completeness, configuration management, and performance monitoring.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the core implementation requires completion of missing features before optimization.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ - Code adheres to established patterns and Node.js best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ - Components are properly organized following the source tree
- Testing Strategy: ✓ - Unit and integration tests exist for implemented functionality
- All ACs Met: ✗ - ACs 5, 6, 7, 8 remain incomplete

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Implement bidirectional sanitization for response flows (AC5)
- [ ] Extend audit logging to include destination and sanitization level (AC6)
- [ ] Create configuration schema for risk level mappings (AC7)
- [ ] Add performance metrics tracking for latency validation (AC8)
- [ ] Update AuditLog model to capture sanitization metadata

- [ ] Add configurable destination risk classifications

### Security Review

Security implementation is robust for implemented features with good defaults for unclear destinations. However, incomplete bidirectional sanitization poses risks for response data protection.

### Performance Considerations

Conditional sanitization should provide performance benefits for low-risk traffic, but without metrics tracking, this cannot be validated or optimized.
