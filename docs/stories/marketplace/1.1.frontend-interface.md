# Story 1.1: MCP Marketplace Frontend Interface

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want to** access a "Marketplace" or "Connections" interface,
**so that** I can view and manage my connections to external MCP servers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a new route/page in the frontend for "Marketplace" or "Connections".
2. Display a list of available MCP servers fetched from the Smithery Registry API.
3. Provide a "Connect" button for each server to handle authorization/authentication.
4. Allow the user to select one "active" MCP server to be used for data routing.
5. Persist the selection and connection details (securely).
6. Implement search functionality to filter servers by name or description.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create new page component `src/pages/Marketplace.tsx` (or similar)
- [ ] Add route definition in `App.tsx`
- [ ] Implement UI for listing servers (cards or table)
- [ ] Implement "Connect" modal/form for server details (URL, API Key)
- [ ] Integrate with Backend API (Story 1.2) to fetch/save config
- [ ] Add visual indicator for "Active" server
- [ ] Implement search bar to filter Smithery registry results

## Dev Notes

- Use existing UI components (Cards, Buttons) from `src/components/ui`
- Ensure responsive design
- Mock API calls initially if Backend (Story 1.2) is not ready
- Use Smithery Registry API: `https://registry.smithery.ai/servers` (via backend proxy)
