# Story 8.1.1: Implement Bidirectional Sanitization and Audit Logging

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,  
**I want** to complete the bidirectional sanitization and audit logging features for destination-aware processing,  
**so that** both requests and responses are properly sanitized according to risk levels and all sanitization activities are fully auditable for compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

5. Bidirectional sanitization is preserved for all traffic types - both requests and responses are processed according to destination risk.
6. Destination detection and applied sanitization level are logged in audit trails for compliance and debugging.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Complete bidirectional sanitization for responses
  - [ ] Implement response destination detection (responses typically return to client)
  - [ ] Ensure response sanitization uses appropriate risk level
  - [ ] Add response sanitization logging
- [ ] Implement destination-aware audit logging
  - [ ] Extend AuditLog model to include destination, risk_level, sanitization_level fields
  - [ ] Add audit logging calls in ProxySanitizer for each sanitization operation
  - [ ] Ensure audit logs capture both request and response sanitization events

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info

- **ProxySanitizer.js**: Main entry point in `src/components/proxy-sanitizer.js` - handles request/response sanitization with destination classification
- **AuditLog.js**: Data model in `src/models/AuditLog.js` - extend to include destination, risk_level, and sanitization_level fields for compliance logging
- **AuditLogger.js**: Logging component in `src/components/data-integrity/AuditLogger.js` - update to capture sanitization audit events

### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `src/tests/unit/` for unit tests, `src/tests/integration/` for integration tests
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest 29.7.0 for unit testing, with mocking for external dependencies
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% for audit logging logic, 80% overall
- **Test Patterns**: AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert), mock all external dependencies
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline testing with mocked destinations, validate bidirectional flow
- **Performance Testing**: Include latency measurements for different sanitization levels

### Key Technical Details

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js 20.11.0, Express.js 4.18.2 for API handling
- **Architecture Patterns**: Extend Proxy Pattern with destination-aware routing, maintain Pipeline Pattern for sanitization
- **Security Requirements**: All traffic maintains minimum security standards, high-risk destinations get comprehensive protection
- **Audit Requirements**: All sanitization operations must be logged with destination context for compliance
- **Bidirectional Processing**: Requests and responses both processed, but responses typically use same risk level as requests (client-bound)
- **Audit Logging**: Extend existing AuditLog model, add sanitization-specific actions like 'data_sanitization_applied'
