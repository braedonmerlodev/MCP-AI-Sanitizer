# Story 4.5: Implement Document Validation and Agent Access Control

## User Story

As an AI agent developer, I want strict validation that ensures agents can only access sanitized and verified documents, so that all AI interactions use trusted, secure data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Document validation system tracks sanitization and verification status in real-time.
2. API middleware blocks all access attempts to non-verified documents.
3. Agent requests require validation tokens or certificates for authentication.
4. Comprehensive audit logging captures all document access attempts and validation checks.
5. Clear, actionable error messages guide developers when validation fails.
6. Access control system supports role-based permissions and different trust levels.
7. Validation status updates automatically and propagates to all access points.

## Implementation Notes

- Create validation middleware for API endpoints
- Implement token/certificate-based authentication
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Create role-based access control system
- Ensure real-time validation status tracking

## Dependencies

- Authentication/authorization libraries
- Database for tracking validation status
- Logging enhancements
- Middleware for access control

## Status

‚è≥ **PENDING** - Ready for development (depends on Stories 4.1-4.4)
