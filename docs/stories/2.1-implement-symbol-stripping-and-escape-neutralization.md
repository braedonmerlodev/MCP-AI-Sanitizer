# Story 2.1: Implement Symbol Stripping and Escape Neutralization

## Status

Validated

## Story

**As a** security user,  
**I want** zero-width characters and ANSI escape codes stripped/neutralized from data flows,  
**so that** hidden instructions cannot execute.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Zero-width and non-printing symbols are detected and removed from inputs/outputs.
2. ANSI escape sequences are neutralized without altering valid content.
3. Bidirectional processing ensures both directions are sanitized.
4. Unit tests cover edge cases like mixed valid/invalid sequences.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement SymbolStripping component (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create SymbolStripping.js in src/components/SanitizationPipeline/
  - [ ] Implement detection and removal of zero-width and non-printing Unicode symbols
  - [ ] Ensure bidirectional processing (input and output flows)
- [ ] Task 2: Implement EscapeNeutralization component (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create EscapeNeutralization.js in src/components/SanitizationPipeline/
  - [ ] Implement neutralization of ANSI escape sequences without altering valid content
  - [ ] Ensure bidirectional processing
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate components into SanitizationPipeline (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update SanitizationPipeline.js to include SymbolStripping and EscapeNeutralization steps
  - [ ] Ensure sequential processing: normalization → stripping → neutralization → redaction
- [ ] Task 4: Write unit tests (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for SymbolStripping.js covering edge cases (mixed valid/invalid symbols)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for EscapeNeutralization.js covering edge cases (mixed valid/invalid sequences)
  - [ ] Achieve 90% test coverage for sanitization logic [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 completed project setup with Node.js 20.11.0, Express.js 4.18.2, and basic folder structure including src/components/. This provides the foundation for implementing sanitization components. [Source: docs/stories/1.1-setup-project-repository-and-dependencies.md]

### Data Models

No specific data models defined for symbol stripping and escape neutralization. The story focuses on processing string data through the pipeline. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

The /sanitize POST endpoint will handle input data for sanitization, and responses will be sanitized before return. Bidirectional processing ensures both request and response data flows are covered. [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/sanitize]

### Component Specifications

SymbolStripping and EscapeNeutralization are sub-components of the SanitizationPipeline, responsible for specific sanitization steps. The ProxySanitizer routes data through the pipeline. [Source: architecture/components.md#ProxySanitizer, architecture/source-tree.md]

### File Locations

- New files: src/components/SanitizationPipeline/SymbolStripping.js, src/components/SanitizationPipeline/EscapeNeutralization.js
- Modified: src/components/SanitizationPipeline.js
- Tests: src/tests/unit/SymbolStripping.test.js, src/tests/unit/EscapeNeutralization.test.js [Source: architecture/source-tree.md, architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Testing Requirements

Use Jest 29.7.0 for unit testing with AAA pattern. Cover edge cases including mixed valid/invalid sequences. Mock external dependencies. 90% coverage for sanitization functions. Tests located in src/tests/unit/ alongside source files. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Technical Constraints

- Node.js 20.11.0 LTS
- Follow camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Use async/await for all async operations
- Log errors with Winston, no console.log in production
- All API responses use ApiResponse wrapper [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

- Unit tests for SymbolStripping and EscapeNeutralization components
- Integration tests for the updated SanitizationPipeline
- Manual verification of bidirectional processing
