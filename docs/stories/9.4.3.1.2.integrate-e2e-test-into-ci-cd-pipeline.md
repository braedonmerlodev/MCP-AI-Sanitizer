# Story 9.4.3.1.2: integrate-e2e-test-into-ci-cd-pipeline

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer,
**I want** the new end-to-end pipeline test integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and documented,
**so that** it runs automatically and is part of the standard quality assurance process.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/), QA documentation (docs/qa/)
- Technology: GitHub Actions, Jest test runner
- Follows pattern: Existing CI/CD integration patterns
- Touch points: Test execution in CI, QA procedures documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Quality Requirements:**

1. Test is integrated into CI/CD pipeline and runs automatically on relevant triggers
2. Test documentation is added to QA procedures
3. No regression in existing functionality verified through test execution in CI

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update GitHub Actions workflow to include the new test, ensure it runs with other integration tests
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Refer to existing workflow files for test execution patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Ensure test execution doesn't significantly impact build times

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Test runs automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated in QA procedures
- [ ] No regressions verified through CI execution
- [ ] CI pipeline passes with new test included

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** CI pipeline changes might affect build reliability
- **Mitigation:** Test changes in a feature branch first
- **Rollback:** Revert workflow changes if issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing CI/CD process
- [ ] Build times remain acceptable
- [ ] Test failures don't block unrelated changes

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session: Yes, workflow and docs updates
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward: Update existing workflow
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly: Matches other test integrations
- [ ] No design or architecture work required: No

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous: Clear CI integration scope
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified: Workflow and docs
- [ ] Success criteria are testable: CI passes with test
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple: Revert changes
