# Story 1.1: Setup Project Repository and Dependencies

## Status

Validated

## Story

**As an** AI developer,  
**I want** a properly configured monorepo with all necessary dependencies installed,  
**so that** development can begin without setup delays.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository is initialized with Node.js/Python project structure and package management.
2. Core dependencies for API endpoints (e.g., Express/FastAPI) and Unicode handling are installed.
3. Basic CI/CD pipeline is configured for automated builds and deployments.
4. Documentation for setup is included in the repo.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Initialize Node.js project structure and package management (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create package.json with Node.js 20.11.0 specification
  - [ ] Set up basic project folder structure matching source tree: src/, infrastructure/, docs/, etc.
  - [ ] Initialize git repository if not already done
- [ ] Task 2: Install core dependencies for API endpoints and Unicode handling (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install Express.js 4.18.2 for API endpoints
  - [ ] Install Unicode handling libraries (e.g., for normalization)
  - [ ] Install other core dependencies: Winston 3.11.0 for logging, Joi 17.11.0 for validation, Jest 29.7.0 for testing
- [ ] Task 3: Configure basic CI/CD pipeline (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and deployments
  - [ ] Configure Docker 24.0.7 containerization
  - [ ] Add basic health check and build steps
- [ ] Task 4: Include documentation for setup (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create README.md with setup instructions
  - [ ] Document dependency installation process
  - [ ] Include basic project overview and getting started guide

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models
No specific data models defined yet for this foundational story. [Source: architecture/data-models.md - not applicable at this stage]

### API Specifications
Basic API structure to be established: /sanitize POST endpoint for input sanitization, /health GET for health checks. [Source: architecture.md#REST API Spec]

### Component Specifications
Initial components to create: ProxySanitizer.js as main entry point, basic pipeline structure. [Source: architecture.md#Components - ProxySanitizer]

### File Locations
- Project root: package.json, Dockerfile, README.md
- src/: app.js, components/, models/, routes/, utils/, config/, tests/
- infrastructure/: azure-bicep/main.bicep
- .github/workflows/: deploy.yml for CI/CD
Follow the exact source tree structure from architecture/source-tree.md

### Testing Requirements
- Use Jest 29.7.0 for unit testing
- Tests in src/tests/ folder, named *.test.js
- Cover unit tests for core functionality, integration for API endpoints
- 80% overall coverage, 90% for critical functions [Source: architecture.md#Test Strategy and Standards]

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js 20.11.0 LTS
- Follow coding standards: ESLint with standard config, camelCase variables, PascalCase classes
- No console.log in production, use Winston logger
- All API responses use ApiResponse wrapper
- Async/await for all async operations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

- Unit tests for dependency installation and basic setup
- Integration tests for CI/CD pipeline execution
- Manual verification of documentation accuracy
