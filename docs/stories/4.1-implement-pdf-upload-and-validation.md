# Story 4.1: Implement PDF Upload and Validation

## User Story

As a content curator, I want to upload PDF documents through a secure API endpoint, so that documents can be validated and prepared for processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. POST `/api/documents/upload` endpoint accepts PDF file uploads with multipart/form-data.
2. File validation ensures only PDF files are accepted (MIME type, file extension, magic bytes).
3. File size limits are enforced (configurable, default 25MB per document).
4. Upload progress tracking and status responses are provided to clients.
5. Comprehensive error handling for invalid files, size limits exceeded, and server errors.
6. Request rate limiting prevents abuse of the upload endpoint.
7. File storage is temporary and secure during processing.

## Implementation Notes

- Use multer for multipart/form-data handling
- Implement multi-layer validation (extension, MIME type, magic bytes)
- Add express-rate-limit for abuse prevention
- Store files temporarily in memory for security
- Return structured JSON responses with upload status

## Dependencies

- multer: File upload handling
- express-rate-limit: Rate limiting
- file-type: MIME type validation (optional, can use magic bytes)

## Validation Checklist ✅

- ✅ **User Story**: Clear and follows "As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: 7 specific, testable criteria covering all requirements
- ✅ **Implementation Notes**: Detailed technical guidance provided
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Required packages identified (multer, express-rate-limit)
- ✅ **Testable**: All acceptance criteria are verifiable through automated tests
- ✅ **Independent**: No blocking dependencies on other stories

## Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED** - All acceptance criteria implemented and tested

### **What Was Implemented:**

- ✅ POST `/api/documents/upload` endpoint with multipart/form-data support
- ✅ Multi-layer file validation (extension, MIME type, magic bytes)
- ✅ 25MB file size limit enforcement
- ✅ Rate limiting (10 uploads per 15 minutes per IP)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- ✅ Secure temporary storage (memory-based, not persisted to disk)
- ✅ Structured JSON status responses
- ✅ Full test coverage (6 new test cases)

### **Technical Details:**

- **Dependencies Added**: multer, express-rate-limit, pdf-parse
- **Security**: Memory storage prevents disk persistence, rate limiting prevents abuse
- **Validation**: Extension + MIME type + magic byte verification
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different failure types
- **Testing**: 39 total tests passing (33 existing + 6 new)

### **API Usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST -F "pdf=@document.pdf" http://localhost:3000/api/documents/upload
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "PDF uploaded successfully",
  "fileName": "document.pdf",
  "size": 12345,
  "status": "uploaded"
}
```

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Ready for Story 4.2 implementation
