# Story 5.1: Implement Destination Tracking - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a system integrator,
I want to track and identify MCP traffic destinations,
So that the sanitization pipeline can determine when content will enter LLM context windows.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing API endpoints and sanitization pipeline
- Technology: Node.js, Express.js middleware
- Follows pattern: Current request processing and middleware patterns
- Touch points: API routes, request headers/metadata analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Request metadata analysis identifies traffic destined for LLM consumption
2. Destination classification logic distinguishes LLM-bound vs non-LLM traffic
3. Classification metadata is attached to requests for pipeline use
4. Fallback classification defaults to full sanitization when unclear

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing middleware pattern
7. Integration with sanitization pipeline maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
9. Documentation is updated for new classification logic
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add middleware to analyze request context (headers, path, metadata) before routing to sanitization
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows current middleware pattern used in API routes
- **Key Constraints:** Must be lightweight to avoid performance impact, classification logic should be configurable

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Incorrect classification could lead to insufficient sanitization
- **Mitigation:** Implement conservative fallback to full sanitization
- **Rollback:** Remove middleware and revert to full sanitization

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
