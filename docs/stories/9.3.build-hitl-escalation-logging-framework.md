# Story 9.3: Build HITL Escalation Logging Framework

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,  
**I want** to create an auditable logging framework for human-in-the-loop escalation decisions and outcomes,  
**so that** all HITL interventions are properly tracked for compliance and continuous improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. HITL escalation decisions are logged with complete context including trigger conditions and decision rationale
2. Human intervention outcomes are logged with resolution details and effectiveness metrics
3. Escalation logging supports audit compliance requirements
4. Framework integrates with existing audit logging infrastructure
5. Log entries enable analysis of HITL effectiveness and decision patterns

## Dependencies

- Story 9.1: Comprehensive Risk Assessment Logging

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design HITL escalation log schema with compliance fields
- [ ] Implement escalation decision logging methods
- [ ] Implement human intervention outcome logging methods
- [ ] Add escalation trigger condition tracking
- [ ] Integrate HITL logging with audit infrastructure
- [ ] Add unit tests for HITL logging functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for escalation workflow logging
- [ ] Update documentation for HITL logging framework
