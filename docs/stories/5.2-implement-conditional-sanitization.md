# Story 5.2: Implement Conditional Sanitization Pipeline - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a security engineer,
I want the sanitization pipeline to apply sanitization only when content is destined for LLM consumption,
So that performance is improved by bypassing unnecessary processing for non-LLM traffic.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing SanitizationPipeline.js and destination tracking
- Technology: Node.js, existing sanitization components
- Follows pattern: Current pipeline processing pattern
- Touch points: SanitizationPipeline.js, SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Pipeline checks destination classification before applying sanitization steps
2. LLM-bound content receives full sanitization (SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization, etc.)
3. Non-LLM content bypasses sanitization while maintaining data integrity:
   - Data Type and Format: Strict schema validation on all data with type/format checks
   - Consistency: Referential integrity enforced where required
   - Completeness: Critical fields validated for null values
   - Atomic Operations: All-or-nothing loading mechanism
   - Read-Only Access: Sanitized layer strictly read-only except for automated pipeline
4. Clear logging distinguishes processed vs bypassed content

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing sanitization components continue to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing pipeline pattern
7. Integration with destination tracking maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
9. Documentation is updated for conditional logic
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Modify SanitizationPipeline.js to check destination metadata before processing
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows current sequential processing pattern (normalization → stripping → neutralization → redaction)
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain data integrity for bypassed content including schema validation, referential integrity, and atomic operations; performance improvement should be measurable
- **Data Integrity Requirements:**
  - Schema validation with type/format checking
  - Referential integrity enforcement
  - Null value validation for critical fields
  - Atomic loading mechanisms (transaction/temporary table swap)
  - Read-only access control for sanitized layer

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Bypassed content could contain security issues if misclassified
- **Mitigation:** Conservative classification with fallback to full sanitization
- **Rollback:** Revert pipeline changes to always sanitize

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is positive (reduced processing)
