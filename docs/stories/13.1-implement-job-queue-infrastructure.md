# Story 13.1: Implement Job Queue Infrastructure

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system architect,  
**I want** to implement a job queue infrastructure with background processing capabilities,  
**so that** long-running sanitization tasks like PDF processing can be handled asynchronously without blocking the main API threads.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Job queue system is successfully set up with queue management and persistence
2. Worker processes are implemented and can execute background jobs
3. Queue system supports job prioritization and retry logic
4. Existing synchronous API endpoints remain unchanged and functional
5. Database schema changes are backward compatible
6. No disruption to existing n8n integration patterns
7. Performance impact on non-async operations is minimal (<5% overhead)
8. Comprehensive testing verifies existing functionality remains intact

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Select and integrate job queue library (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Evaluate queue options (Bull with Redis, Agenda with MongoDB, or SQLite-based solution)
  - [x] Add queue library to package.json dependencies
  - [x] Configure queue connection settings in config
- [x] Task 2: Implement job queue infrastructure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create queue manager module in src/utils/queueManager.js
  - [x] Implement worker process setup in src/workers/
  - [x] Add job persistence layer using existing SQLite database
- [x] Task 3: Add job status tracking and management (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Implement job status model extending existing data models
  - [x] Add job creation, update, and retrieval functions
  - [x] Implement retry logic and error handling for failed jobs
- [ ] Task 4: Integration and compatibility testing (AC: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Run existing test suite to verify no regressions
  - [ ] Test n8n webhook integration remains functional
  - [ ] Performance benchmark synchronous endpoints
  - [ ] Validate database schema backward compatibility

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories in epic 13 - this is the first story.

### Data Models

- Extend existing SanitizationEvent model to include jobId for async tracking [Source: architecture/data-models.md#SanitizationEvent]
- Add new JobStatus model with attributes: id, jobId, status (queued, processing, completed, failed), createdAt, updatedAt, retryCount, errorMessage [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

- No new API endpoints for this infrastructure story - queue is internal [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

### Component Specifications

- Queue manager should follow proxy pattern similar to ProxySanitizer [Source: architecture/components.md#ProxySanitizer]
- Worker processes should integrate with existing SanitizationPipeline components [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#SanitizationPipeline]

### File Locations

- New queue manager: src/utils/queueManager.js [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#utils]
- Worker processes: src/workers/jobWorker.js [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#src]
- Job models: src/models/JobStatus.js [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#models]

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for queue manager and worker functions with 90% coverage [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]
- Integration tests for job persistence and worker execution [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Integration Tests]
- Mock external dependencies using Sinon [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]
- Test files in src/tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#tests]

### Technical Constraints

- Use Node.js async/await patterns, no callbacks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Node.js Specifics]
- Follow camelCase naming for variables and functions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]
- Use Winston for logging, no console.log [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]
- SQLite for persistence to maintain existing tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- Framework: Jest 29.7.0 for unit tests [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]
- File Convention: \*.test.js alongside source files [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]
- Location: src/tests/unit/ for unit tests, tests/integration/ for integration [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#tests]
- Coverage: 90% for queue and worker logic [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Testing Philosophy]
- Mocking: Sinon for external dependencies [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]
- AAA Pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert for all tests [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#AI Agent Requirements]
