# Story 1.9.4: Verify Escalation Logging Functionality

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security environment,
**I want to** verify HITL escalation logging works end-to-end,
**so that** escalation events are properly logged and auditable.

**Business Context:**
End-to-end verification ensures that HITL escalation logging not only passes tests but provides reliable audit trails for security incidents. This validates the complete escalation and logging pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Execute end-to-end escalation logging workflows
- [ ] Validate log entries for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Confirm integration with escalation processing systems
- [ ] Document verification results and logging quality

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete escalation to logging pipeline
- **Log Validation**: Check log entry accuracy and format
- **Integration Testing**: Verify with escalation processing systems
- **Quality Metrics**: Gather logging completeness and accuracy metrics

**Dependencies:**

- HITL escalation system
- Logging infrastructure
- Audit and monitoring systems
- Escalation processing workflows

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Risk Level:** Low (validation only)

**Success Metrics:**

- Successful end-to-end escalation logging
- Accurate and complete log entries
- Integration with escalation systems verified
- Logging quality metrics documented
