# Story 1.9.3: Ensure All HITL Escalation Tests Pass

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security environment,
**I want to** achieve 100% pass rate for HITL escalation tests,
**so that** escalation logging functionality is fully validated.

**Business Context:**
Comprehensive test coverage ensures HITL escalation logging works correctly under all conditions. Passing tests provide confidence in the security and reliability of human-in-the-loop escalation processes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Run complete HITL escalation test suite
- [ ] Fix any remaining test failures
- [ ] Ensure test stability across multiple executions
- [ ] Document test results and coverage

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **Test Execution**: Run full test suite multiple times
- **Failure Resolution**: Debug and fix remaining issues
- **Stability Verification**: Confirm consistent pass rates
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure adequate test scenarios

**Dependencies:**

- HITL escalation test suite
- Test execution environment
- Debugging and logging tools

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Risk Level:** Low (test fixes only)

**Success Metrics:**

- 100% test pass rate
- Test stability across runs
- Comprehensive logging test coverage
