# Story 1.1.3: Automated Vulnerability Resolution

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer working in a brownfield security environment,
**I want to** execute automated vulnerability fixes using npm audit,
**so that** auto-fixable security issues are resolved efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create system backup before any changes (package-lock.json, node_modules) in `backups/pre-vulnerability-fix/`
2. Run `npm audit fix --force` to resolve auto-fixable vulnerabilities (js-yaml, tough-cookie, node-notifier, braces), documented in `docs/automated-fixes-log.md`
3. Verify Express ecosystem packages updated to secure versions (express 4.21.2+, body-parser 1.20.3+, cookie 0.7.1+, path-to-regexp 0.1.12+, send 0.19.0+), documented in `docs/package-update-report.md`
4. Confirm Jest compatibility after package updates (upgrade to 29.x if needed), validated in `docs/jest-compatibility-test.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: System Backup Creation (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create backup directory `backups/pre-vulnerability-fix/`
  - [x] Backup package-lock.json and package.json
  - [x] Create node_modules backup if needed
  - [x] Verify backup integrity
- [x] Task 2: Automated Vulnerability Fixes (AC: 2)
  - [x] Run npm audit to identify current vulnerabilities
  - [x] Execute `npm audit fix --force` command
  - [x] Log all changes made by the fix command
  - [x] Document fixes applied in `docs/automated-fixes-log.md`
- [x] Task 3: Package Version Verification (AC: 3)
  - [x] Check updated package versions in package.json
  - [x] Verify Express ecosystem packages meet minimum versions
  - [x] Run npm ls to confirm dependency tree
  - [x] Document version changes in `docs/package-update-report.md`
- [x] Task 4: Jest Compatibility Validation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Run npm test to verify Jest functionality
  - [x] Execute integration tests if available
  - [x] Check for any test failures related to package updates
  - [x] Document compatibility results in `docs/jest-compatibility-test.md`

## Dev Notes

Automated vulnerability resolution provides the quickest path to fixing known security issues. Using npm audit fix ensures that compatible updates are applied while maintaining package compatibility.

### Relevant Source Tree

- `package.json` - Dependency definitions and versions
- `package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
- `node_modules/` - Installed package dependencies
- `backups/` - Backup storage location

### Testing

- Run npm test suite to validate Jest compatibility
- Execute npm audit to confirm vulnerabilities resolved
- Test basic application functionality after updates
- Document any compatibility issues found
