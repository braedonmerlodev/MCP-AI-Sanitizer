# Story 1.2.5: Integration Testing & Validation

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security environment,
**I want to** execute comprehensive integration testing for AdminOverrideController,
**so that** all fixes are validated in the full security system context.

**Business Context:**
Integration testing ensures that AdminOverrideController fixes work correctly within the broader security ecosystem. Comprehensive validation prevents regressions and confirms that emergency access functionality operates properly end-to-end.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Run full AdminOverrideController test suite (all tests pass)
- [ ] Execute integration tests with authentication and authorization systems
- [ ] Validate admin override functionality in end-to-end security workflows
- [ ] Confirm no performance degradation in override operations
- [ ] Verify audit logging and monitoring integration

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **Test Suite Execution**: Run complete AdminOverrideController tests
- **Integration Testing**: Test with auth and authorization systems
- **End-to-End Validation**: Verify security workflow functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Check for degradation in override operations
- **Audit Verification**: Confirm logging and monitoring integration

**Dependencies:**

- Complete AdminOverrideController test suite
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Security workflow processes
- Performance monitoring tools
- Audit logging infrastructure

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Risk Level:** Medium (comprehensive system validation)

**Success Metrics:**

- All tests pass consistently
- Integration with auth systems verified
- End-to-end workflows functional
- Performance within acceptable limits
- Audit integration confirmed
