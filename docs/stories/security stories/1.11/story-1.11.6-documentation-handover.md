# Story 1.11.6: Documentation & Handover

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** document coverage improvements and hand over knowledge for simplified local testing,
**so that** the development team can maintain and extend test coverage in local workflows.

**Business Context:**
Documentation of coverage improvements is essential for ongoing maintenance. This brownfield handover must provide clear guidance for the development team on coverage practices in local testing scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Update test documentation with new coverage scenarios and test cases
- [x] Document coverage improvement methodology and security testing priorities
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for future coverage maintenance
- [x] Update security hardening documentation with coverage improvement achievements
- [x] Hand over knowledge to development team for ongoing test coverage management

**Technical Notes:**

- Document local testing specific coverage practices
- Provide guidance for maintaining 80%+ coverage
- Include troubleshooting for common coverage issues

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 1-2 hours
