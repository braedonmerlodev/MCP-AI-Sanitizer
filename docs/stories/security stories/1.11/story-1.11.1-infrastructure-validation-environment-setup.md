# Story 1.11.1: Infrastructure Validation & Environment Setup

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** validate Jest testing infrastructure and coverage reporting setup for simplified local testing,
**so that** test coverage improvements can be implemented reliably in local development.

**Business Context:**
Before improving test coverage, the testing infrastructure must be validated to ensure coverage reporting works correctly. This brownfield setup must confirm the local testing environment is ready for coverage analysis without disrupting existing development workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Validate Jest testing infrastructure and coverage reporting setup
- [ ] Confirm test environment stability and baseline coverage metrics
- [ ] Assess existing test framework compatibility with coverage improvements
- [ ] Document current coverage baseline and gap analysis
- [ ] Analyze codebase structure and identify security-critical components requiring coverage
- [ ] Establish coverage improvement baseline (current coverage state documented)
- [ ] Identify integration points with existing test suites and CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Document critical security workflows requiring comprehensive test coverage

**Technical Notes:**

- Focus on local development environment setup
- Ensure coverage tools work with simplified testing scenarios
- Validate baseline before making changes

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 1-2 hours
