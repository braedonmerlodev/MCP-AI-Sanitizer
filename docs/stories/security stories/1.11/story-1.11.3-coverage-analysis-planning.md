# Story 1.11.3: Coverage Analysis & Planning

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** generate comprehensive coverage reports and create improvement plans for simplified local testing,
**so that** test coverage gaps are identified and prioritized for local development scenarios.

**Business Context:**
Before implementing new tests, a detailed analysis of current coverage is needed to identify gaps. This brownfield planning must focus on local testing scenarios and prioritize improvements that support agent development with local models.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Generate comprehensive coverage report identifying all uncovered code paths
- [ ] Prioritize security-critical components for coverage improvement
- [ ] Create detailed test plan for coverage gaps (unit tests, integration tests, edge cases)
- [ ] Identify test scenarios that would improve coverage without excessive complexity
- [ ] Ensure coverage improvement plan aligns with security hardening objectives

**Technical Notes:**

- Focus analysis on local model integration paths
- Prioritize core functionality over security features
- Create actionable plan for incremental improvements

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours
