# Story 1.11.3.4: Identify Test Scenarios and Ensure Alignment

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** identify test scenarios that improve coverage without excessive complexity and ensure the plan aligns with security hardening objectives,
**so that** the coverage improvement efforts are efficient and strategically aligned.

**Business Context:**
Not all possible tests are practical to implement, especially in a brownfield environment. This final step ensures that selected test scenarios provide maximum coverage improvement with minimal complexity, while maintaining alignment with the overall security hardening goals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Review test plan for complexity and feasibility
- [ ] Identify high-impact, low-complexity test scenarios
- [ ] Validate that scenarios address prioritized security components
- [ ] Ensure test scenarios support local model development
- [ ] Confirm alignment with security hardening objectives
- [ ] Finalize comprehensive coverage improvement plan

**Technical Notes:**

- Evaluate implementation effort vs. coverage gain
- Focus on scenarios testable in local environment
- Consider maintainability and long-term value
- Ensure plan supports incremental implementation

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 30 minutes
