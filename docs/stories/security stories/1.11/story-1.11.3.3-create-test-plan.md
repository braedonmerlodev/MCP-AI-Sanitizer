# Story 1.11.3.3: Create Detailed Test Plan for Coverage Gaps

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** create a detailed test plan for coverage gaps including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases,
**so that** there is a clear roadmap for improving test coverage incrementally.

**Business Context:**
Once coverage gaps are identified and prioritized, a structured plan is needed to address them systematically. This plan should include specific test cases that can be implemented without excessive complexity, focusing on local testing scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Review coverage report and prioritization matrix
- [ ] Design unit tests for uncovered functions and methods
- [ ] Plan integration tests for uncovered workflows
- [ ] Identify edge cases and error conditions to test
- [ ] Create prioritized list of test cases with implementation estimates
- [ ] Document test plan in structured format for development team

**Technical Notes:**

- Focus on testable code paths in local environment
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Consider mocking strategies for external dependencies
- Align with existing testing framework and patterns

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 1 hour
