# Story 1.5.6: Documentation & Handover

**As a** Product Owner managing brownfield security hardening,
**I want to** document all TrustTokenGenerator environment validation fixes and hand over to development team,
**so that** implementation can proceed with complete understanding and traceability.

Comprehensive documentation ensures that TrustTokenGenerator fixes are transparent and maintainable in brownfield environments. This handover provides the development team with all necessary context for safe deployment of environment validation changes without disrupting critical content reuse operations.
