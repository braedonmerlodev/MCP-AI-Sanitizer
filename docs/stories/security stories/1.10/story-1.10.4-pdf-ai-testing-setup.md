### Scope Clarification

This story focuses on **enhancing and expanding** the existing testing setup rather than building from scratch. The emphasis is on advanced testing capabilities that complement the current solid foundation.

### Technical Considerations

- **Mock Realism**: ✅ Already implemented - AI mocks include metadata, token usage, and error conditions
- **Test Isolation**: ✅ Already implemented - Tests use mocked AI services and PDF processing
- **Performance Testing**: 🔄 Needs enhancement - Current tests have basic performance validation
- **Error Scenarios**: 🔄 Needs expansion - Current tests cover basic fallback, need comprehensive error coverage

### Brownfield Environment Challenges

- **Compatibility**: ✅ Resolved - Existing infrastructure works with AI workflow components
- **Document Formats**: 🔄 Needs testing - Current mocks handle basic PDFs, need format variation testing
- **Test Data**: 🔄 Needs expansion - Current test data is minimal, need diverse real-world scenarios

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- ✅ Story 1.10.3 completion (AI workflow integration fixes) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Jest test framework configuration - EXISTS
- ✅ PDF processing and AI service mock components - EXISTS
