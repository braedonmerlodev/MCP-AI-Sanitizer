# Story 1.8.3: Ensure All TrainingDataCollector Tests Pass

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security environment,
**I want to** ensure all TrainingDataCollector tests pass consistently,
**so that** training data collection quality is validated.

**Business Context:**
Comprehensive test coverage ensures that training data collection works reliably. Passing tests provide confidence in the data quality for AI model training and prevent regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Run complete TrainingDataCollector test suite
- [ ] Fix any remaining test failures
- [ ] Ensure test stability across multiple runs
- [ ] Document test coverage and edge cases

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **Test Execution**: Run full test suite multiple times
- **Failure Analysis**: Debug and fix remaining test issues
- **Stability Testing**: Verify tests pass consistently
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure adequate test coverage

**Dependencies:**

- TrainingDataCollector test suite
- Test execution environment
- Debugging tools and logs

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 3-4 hours
**Risk Level:** Low (test fixes only)

**Success Metrics:**

- 100% test pass rate
- Test stability across runs
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained
