# Story 1.8.4: Verify Training Data Collection Functionality

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security environment,
**I want to** verify that training data collection functionality works end-to-end,
**so that** collected data meets quality standards for AI training.

**Business Context:**
End-to-end verification ensures that training data collection not only passes tests but produces high-quality data suitable for machine learning model training. This validates the complete data pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Execute end-to-end training data collection workflows
- [ ] Validate data quality and format standards
- [ ] Confirm integration with downstream AI processing
- [ ] Document verification results and data quality metrics

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete data collection pipeline
- **Data Validation**: Check data quality and format compliance
- **Integration Testing**: Verify with AI processing systems
- **Metrics Collection**: Gather data quality and performance metrics

**Dependencies:**

- Training data collection pipeline
- Data quality validation tools
- AI processing integration points
- Data storage and retrieval systems

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Risk Level:** Low (validation only)

**Success Metrics:**

- Successful end-to-end data collection
- Data quality standards met
- Integration with AI systems verified
- Quality metrics documented
