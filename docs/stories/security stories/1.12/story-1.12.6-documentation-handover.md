# Story 1.12.6: Documentation & Handover

**As a** Product Owner managing brownfield security hardening completion,
**I want to** document all security hardening changes and hand over the validated codebase to development team,
**so that** DeepAgent CLI implementation can proceed with complete understanding and traceability.
