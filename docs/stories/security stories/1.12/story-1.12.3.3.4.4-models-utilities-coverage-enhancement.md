# Story 1.12.3.3.4.4: Models and Utilities Coverage Enhancement

## Status

Not Started

## Story

**As a** QA lead working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** add unit tests for uncovered lines in model and utility modules,
**so that** models and utilities coverage increases by at least 5% towards the 80% target.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. At least 5 additional unit tests added for model and utility modules
2. Line coverage in model and utility modules reaches 90% or higher
3. New tests target previously uncovered lines and edge cases

**Integration Requirements:** 4. Existing model and utility functionality continues to work unchanged 5. New functionality follows existing test patterns and standards 6. Integration with existing test suite maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:** 7. Change is covered by appropriate tests 8. No regression in existing functionality verified 9. Tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Identify uncovered lines in model and utility modules
- [ ] Write 5+ additional unit tests targeting uncovered lines
- [ ] Run coverage analysis to verify improvement in models and utilities coverage
- [ ] Ensure tests integrate with existing test suite without conflicts

## Dev Notes

This is a focused substory to address line coverage gaps in model and utility execution paths within the brownfield security hardening context.

### Testing

- Focus on model validations, utility functions, and helper modules
- Target: Cover 20-30 additional lines in models and utilities
- Use Jest for test execution and coverage measurement
