# Story 1.12.3.3.4.2.3.7: JobStatusController Test Suite Integration

## Status

Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** ensure new JobStatusController tests integrate properly with the existing test suite,
**so that** all tests run successfully and maintain suite integrity without conflicts.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. All new JobStatusController tests run successfully in full test suite
2. No conflicts or interference with existing tests
3. Test execution time remains within acceptable limits
4. New tests follow existing naming and organization conventions

**Integration Requirements:** 5. Tests integrate with existing Jest configuration 6. No breaking changes to test infrastructure 7. CI/CD pipeline continues to pass with new tests

**Quality Requirements:** 8. Test suite reliability is maintained 9. No flaky tests introduced 10. Test isolation and cleanup are proper

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Run full test suite with new JobStatusController tests
- [ ] Verify no test conflicts or failures
- [ ] Check test execution performance
- [ ] Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup
- [ ] Confirm CI/CD integration works correctly

## Dev Notes

Final integration check to ensure test suite remains healthy with new additions.

### Testing

- Full test suite execution
- Performance monitoring
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Dependencies and Risks

- Depends on completion of all test writing substories
- Low risk integration task
- Brownfield context: Preserve existing test suite behavior
