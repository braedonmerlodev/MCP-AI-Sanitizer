# Story 1.12.4: Security Hardening Verification

**As a** QA lead working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** verify all security hardening fixes and controls are effective,
**so that** the production system maintains robust security posture after deployment.

**Business Context:**
Security hardening verification is critical for QA sign-off in brownfield environments where all previous security fixes must be validated as effective. This ensures that vulnerabilities have been properly addressed and security controls are functioning correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Verify all security vulnerability fixes from Stories 1.1-1.11 are effective
- [ ] Validate security controls and threat detection mechanisms
- [ ] Confirm API security, data sanitization, and trust token functionality
- [ ] Test security monitoring and audit logging capabilities
- [ ] Validate compliance with security hardening requirements

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **Vulnerability Verification**: Confirm fixes from Stories 1.1-1.11 are effective
- **Security Controls Validation**: Test threat detection and prevention mechanisms
- **API Security Confirmation**: Validate API security, data sanitization, trust tokens
- **Monitoring Verification**: Test security monitoring and audit logging
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure security hardening requirements are met

**Dependencies:**

- All security hardening stories (1.1-1.11)
- Security controls and monitoring systems
- Threat detection mechanisms
- Audit logging capabilities

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 3-4 hours
**Risk Level:** High (security verification)

**Success Metrics:**

- All security vulnerability fixes verified effective
- Security controls and threat detection validated
- API security, data sanitization, and trust tokens confirmed
- Security monitoring and audit logging tested
- Security hardening requirements compliance validated
