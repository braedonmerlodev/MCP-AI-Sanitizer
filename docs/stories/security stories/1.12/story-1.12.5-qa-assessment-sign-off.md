# Story 1.12.5: QA Assessment & Sign-Off

**As a** QA lead working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** complete comprehensive QA assessment and provide formal sign-off for production deployment,
**so that** the codebase is officially approved for DeepAgent CLI implementation.

**Business Context:**
QA assessment and sign-off is the final critical gate in brownfield security hardening, providing formal approval that all security fixes have been properly implemented and validated. This ensures production deployment can proceed with confidence in system security and stability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Complete comprehensive QA assessment report
- [ ] Document all validation findings and test results
- [ ] Provide formal QA sign-off for production deployment
- [ ] Create security hardening completion certificate
- [ ] Establish ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **QA Assessment Report**: Complete comprehensive assessment documentation
- **Validation Findings**: Document all test results and findings
- **Formal Sign-Off**: Provide official QA approval for production deployment
- **Completion Certificate**: Create security hardening completion documentation
- **Monitoring Procedures**: Establish ongoing security monitoring and maintenance

**Dependencies:**

- All previous validation results (Stories 1.12.1-1.12.4)
- Security hardening completion data
- Production deployment approval processes
- Ongoing monitoring requirements

**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Risk Level:** High (production deployment approval)

**Success Metrics:**

- Comprehensive QA assessment report completed
- All validation findings documented
- Formal QA sign-off provided
- Security hardening completion certificate created
- Ongoing monitoring procedures established
