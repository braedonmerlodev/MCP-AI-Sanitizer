# Story 1.12.3.3.4.2.3.6: JobStatusController Coverage Verification

## Status

Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** QA engineer working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** run coverage analysis and verify improvements after adding new tests,
**so that** the coverage enhancement goal is confirmed achieved and documented.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Post-implementation coverage analysis is run on JobStatusController
2. Coverage improvement is measured against baseline from substory 1
3. Minimum 5% coverage increase or 85% total coverage is achieved
4. New tests cover previously identified uncovered lines

**Integration Requirements:** 5. Coverage analysis uses existing CI/CD tools 6. Results are integrated into coverage reporting 7. No impact on existing coverage metrics for other components

**Quality Requirements:** 8. Coverage analysis is accurate and reproducible 9. Improvement is verified through multiple test runs 10. Results are documented and shared with team

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Run full test suite with coverage analysis
- [ ] Compare current coverage to baseline metrics
- [ ] Verify minimum coverage improvement threshold met
- [ ] Document coverage improvements and remaining gaps
- [ ] Ensure coverage reports are updated in CI/CD

## Dev Notes

Final verification that coverage enhancement objectives are met.

### Testing

- Run comprehensive coverage analysis
- Compare before/after metrics
- Validate that new tests contribute to coverage goals

### Dependencies and Risks

- Depends on completion of all test writing substories
- Low risk verification task
- Brownfield context: Verification of existing test suite
