# Story 1.12.3.2: Perform Security Vulnerability Assessment

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** QA lead working in a brownfield security hardening environment,
**I want to** perform security vulnerability assessment (npm audit),
**so that** there are zero critical vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Perform security vulnerability assessment (npm audit) - zero critical vulnerabilities

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Run npm audit command
- [ ] Review audit results for critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Address any critical vulnerabilities found

## Dev Notes

Security vulnerability assessment ensures that no critical security issues remain in the dependencies after security hardening changes.

### Testing

- Use npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
- Focus on critical severity issues
- Address any findings appropriately
