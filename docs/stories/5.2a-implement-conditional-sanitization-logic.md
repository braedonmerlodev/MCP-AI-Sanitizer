# Story 5.2a: Implement Conditional Sanitization Logic - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a security engineer,
I want the sanitization pipeline to apply sanitization only when content is destined for LLM consumption,
So that performance is improved by bypassing unnecessary processing for non-LLM traffic.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing SanitizationPipeline.js and destination tracking (Story 5.1)
- Technology: Node.js, existing sanitization components
- Follows pattern: Current pipeline processing pattern
- Touch points: SanitizationPipeline.js, SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Pipeline checks destination classification before applying sanitization steps
2. LLM-bound content receives full sanitization (SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization, etc.)
3. Non-LLM content bypasses sanitization while maintaining basic data integrity
4. Clear logging distinguishes processed vs bypassed content

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing sanitization components continue to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing pipeline pattern
7. Integration with destination tracking maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
9. Documentation is updated for conditional logic
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Modify SanitizationPipeline.js sanitize method to accept classification parameter
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows current sequential processing pattern (normalization → stripping → neutralization → redaction)
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain data integrity for bypassed content, performance improvement should be measurable
- **Scope:** Core conditional logic only - advanced data integrity handled in 5.2b

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Bypassed content could contain security issues if misclassified
- **Mitigation:** Conservative classification with fallback to full sanitization
- **Rollback:** Revert pipeline changes to always sanitize

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is positive (reduced processing)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 5.1 completed destination tracking middleware that attaches classification metadata to requests. This provides the foundation for conditional sanitization based on traffic destination. [Source: docs/stories/5.1-implement-destination-tracking.md]

### Data Models

No new data models required. Classification metadata is passed as options to the sanitize method. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

The existing /sanitize and /webhook/n8n endpoints will support conditional sanitization through internal classification. No API changes required. [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

### Component Specifications

SanitizationPipeline.sanitize method will be enhanced with conditional logic based on classification options. [Source: architecture/components.md#SanitizationPipeline]

### File Locations

- Modified: src/components/sanitization-pipeline.js
- Modified: src/components/proxy-sanitizer.js
- Tests: src/tests/unit/sanitization-pipeline-conditional.test.js, src/tests/integration/conditional-sanitization.test.js [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements

Use Jest for unit testing conditional logic with mocked classification data. Integration tests should verify end-to-end conditional behavior. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Technical Constraints

- Node.js 20.11.0 LTS
- Follow camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Use async/await for all async operations
- Log errors with Winston, no console.log in production
- All API responses use ApiResponse wrapper [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

- Unit tests for conditional pipeline logic
- Integration tests for conditional sanitization behavior
- Manual verification of performance improvements
