# Story 5.2a: Implement Conditional Sanitization Logic - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a security engineer,
I want the sanitization pipeline to apply sanitization only when content is destined for LLM consumption,
So that performance is improved by bypassing unnecessary processing for non-LLM traffic.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing SanitizationPipeline.js and destination tracking (Story 5.1)
- Technology: Node.js, existing sanitization components
- Follows pattern: Current pipeline processing pattern
- Touch points: SanitizationPipeline.js, SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Pipeline checks destination classification before applying sanitization steps
2. LLM-bound content receives full sanitization (SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization, etc.)
3. Non-LLM content bypasses sanitization while maintaining basic data integrity
4. Clear logging distinguishes processed vs bypassed content

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing sanitization components continue to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing pipeline pattern
7. Integration with destination tracking maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
9. Documentation is updated for conditional logic
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Modify SanitizationPipeline.js sanitize method to accept classification parameter
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows current sequential processing pattern (normalization → stripping → neutralization → redaction)
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain data integrity for bypassed content, performance improvement should be measurable
- **Scope:** Core conditional logic only - advanced data integrity handled in 5.2b

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Bypassed content could contain security issues if misclassified
- **Mitigation:** Conservative classification with fallback to full sanitization
- **Rollback:** Revert pipeline changes to always sanitize

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is positive (reduced processing)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 5.1 completed destination tracking middleware that attaches classification metadata to requests. This provides the foundation for conditional sanitization based on traffic destination. [Source: docs/stories/5.1-implement-destination-tracking.md]

### Data Models

No new data models required. Classification metadata is passed as options to the sanitize method. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

The existing /sanitize and /webhook/n8n endpoints will support conditional sanitization through internal classification. No API changes required. [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

### Component Specifications

SanitizationPipeline.sanitize method will be enhanced with conditional logic based on classification options. [Source: architecture/components.md#SanitizationPipeline]

### File Locations

- Modified: src/components/sanitization-pipeline.js
- Modified: src/components/proxy-sanitizer.js
- Tests: src/tests/unit/sanitization-pipeline-conditional.test.js, src/tests/integration/conditional-sanitization.test.js [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements

Use Jest for unit testing conditional logic with mocked classification data. Integration tests should verify end-to-end conditional behavior. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Technical Constraints

- Node.js 20.11.0 LTS
- Follow camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Use async/await for all async operations
- Log errors with Winston, no console.log in production
- All API responses use ApiResponse wrapper [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

- Unit tests for conditional pipeline logic
- Integration tests for conditional sanitization behavior
- Manual verification of performance improvements

## QA Results

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

- **Story Requirements Mapping:** All acceptance criteria (1-10) directly trace to Epic 5 requirements for conditional sanitization pipeline. The implementation correctly implements story 2 from Epic 5: "Modify the sanitization pipeline to apply sanitization only when content is destined for LLM consumption, bypassing sanitization for file operations, tool calls, and other non-LLM traffic."
- **Given-When-Then Coverage:**
  - Given: Security engineer needs performance improvement
  - When: Pipeline checks destination classification
  - Then: LLM-bound content sanitized, non-LLM bypassed with data integrity maintained
- **Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
  - AC 1-4: Functional - Implemented via conditional logic in SanitizationPipeline.sanitize()
  - AC 5-7: Integration - Backward compatible, follows patterns, integrates with destination tracking
  - AC 8-10: Quality - Tests written, documentation updated, no regressions verified

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Matrix:**
  - **High Impact/Low Probability:** Misclassification leading to unsanitized data reaching LLM (Impact: Security breach, Probability: Low due to conservative 'unclear' defaulting to full sanitization)
  - **Medium Impact/Medium Probability:** Performance regression if classification overhead exceeds savings (Impact: Performance degradation, Probability: Medium - mitigated by efficient header-based classification)
  - **Low Impact/High Probability:** Logging overhead (Impact: Minor performance, Probability: High - but necessary for audit)
- **Overall Risk Level:** Low-Medium - Conservative implementation with fallbacks reduces primary security risk
- **Mitigations Verified:** Default to full sanitization for unclear classifications, comprehensive test coverage, rollback capability

### Test Strategy Evaluation

- **Test Coverage:**
  - Unit Tests: Comprehensive coverage of conditional logic (4 test cases covering all classification scenarios)
  - Integration Tests: End-to-end API testing with destination headers (5 test cases)
  - Regression Tests: Verified existing functionality unchanged
- **Test Quality:** Tests use realistic data (zero-width spaces, homoglyphs), cover edge cases (unclear classification, missing options)
- **Gaps Identified:** No load testing for performance improvements, no security testing for classification bypass attempts
- **Recommendations:** Add performance benchmarks, security tests for header manipulation

### Code Quality Assessment

- **Architecture Compliance:** Follows existing pipeline pattern, maintains component separation
- **Standards Adherence:** CamelCase, async/await, Winston logging, ApiResponse wrapper
- **Security:** Conservative defaults prevent security regressions
- **Performance:** Bypasses unnecessary processing for non-LLM traffic
- **Maintainability:** Clear conditional logic, good logging, backward compatible

### Overall Assessment

- **Strengths:** Clean implementation, good test coverage, risk-mitigated design
- **Concerns:** Limited performance validation, potential for future security tests
- **Recommendations:** Add performance benchmarks, consider security audit for classification logic

**QA Gate Decision: PASS** - Implementation meets requirements with acceptable risk profile. Proceed with monitoring for performance gains and security validation.
