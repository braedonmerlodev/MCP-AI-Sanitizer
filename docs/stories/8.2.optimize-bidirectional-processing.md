# Story 8.2: Optimize Bidirectional Processing

## Status

Review

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,  
**I want** to optimize bidirectional processing in the MCP traffic sanitization pipeline,  
**so that** both request and response sanitization work seamlessly with selective processing based on destination risk levels.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Request sanitization correctly applies full processing for high-risk destinations (LLMs, external tools) and optimized processing for low-risk destinations (internal operations).
2. Response sanitization correctly applies full processing for high-risk destinations and optimized processing for low-risk destinations.
3. Bidirectional flow maintains security integrity without regression in threat neutralization rates.
4. Performance improvements are achieved for low-risk traffic while maintaining <100ms latency for high-risk traffic.
5. Integration with destination-aware logic from Story 8.1 is verified.

## Dependencies

- Story 8.1: Implement Destination-Aware Sanitization Logic (for risk assessment integration)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Review current bidirectional sanitization pipeline implementation in SanitizationPipeline.js
- [x] Implement selective logic for request processing based on destination risk assessment
- [x] Implement selective logic for response processing based on destination risk assessment
- [x] Update pipeline to handle optimized processing paths for low-risk traffic
- [x] Add unit tests for selective bidirectional processing
- [x] Add integration tests for end-to-end selective flows
- [x] Update documentation for selective processing behavior

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info

- **SanitizationPipeline.js**: Located in src/components/SanitizationPipeline.js, handles sequential sanitization steps (UnicodeNormalization, SymbolStripping, EscapeNeutralization, PatternRedaction).
- **ProxySanitizer.js**: Main entry point in src/components/ProxySanitizer.js, intercepts requests and routes through pipeline.
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Requests sanitized via input pipeline, responses via output pipeline as per architecture diagram.
- **Integration Points**: MCP traffic flows through ProxySanitizer, which calls SanitizationPipeline for both directions.

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest in src/tests/unit/, cover selective logic with mocked destinations.
- **Integration Tests**: In src/tests/integration/, test end-to-end with WireMock for LLMs/MCP.
- **Coverage**: 90% for critical sanitization functions.
- **Performance Tests**: Measure latency improvements for low-risk traffic, ensure no degradation for high-risk.

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Validate selective processing logic for requests and responses, mock destination detection.
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests with simulated high-risk and low-risk traffic, verify full vs optimized sanitization.
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark latency improvements for low-risk traffic, ensure no degradation for high-risk.
- **Security Tests**: Regression testing to confirm threat neutralization rates remain ≥90%.
- **Load Tests**: Mixed traffic scenarios to validate selective processing under load.
