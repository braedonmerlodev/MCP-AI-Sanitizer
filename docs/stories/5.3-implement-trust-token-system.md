# Story 5.3: Implement Trust Token System - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a content curator,
I want sanitized content to include cryptographic trust tokens,
So that previously sanitized content can be securely verified and reused without reprocessing.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: /api/documents/upload endpoint and sanitization pipeline
- Technology: Node.js, crypto module for HMAC-SHA256
- Follows pattern: Current API response patterns with structured JSON
- Touch points: Upload endpoint response, sanitization pipeline output

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Trust tokens are generated during sanitization with content hash, rules applied, and signature
2. Upload endpoint returns sanitized content plus trust token in response
3. Tokens include expiration and version information for validation
4. Token validation endpoint allows verification of token authenticity

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing upload endpoint continues to work with enhanced response
6. New functionality follows existing API response pattern
7. Integration with sanitization pipeline maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
9. Documentation is updated for trust token usage
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend upload endpoint to generate and include trust tokens in JSON response
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows current ApiResponse wrapper and JSON structure patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Cryptographic operations must be performant, token format should be standardized

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Token generation could impact upload performance
- **Mitigation:** Optimize cryptographic operations and cache where possible
- **Rollback:** Remove token generation and revert to original response format

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs (additive enhancement)
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
