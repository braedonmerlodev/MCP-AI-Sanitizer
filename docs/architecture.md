# Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent adopts a proxy-based architecture style, acting as an intermediary layer between MCP servers and LLMs to perform real-time sanitization. Key components include the sanitization pipeline (normalization, stripping, neutralization, redaction), API endpoints for n8n integration, and cloud infrastructure for hosting. Primary technology choices emphasize Node.js or Python for backend development, with Docker for containerization and AWS/GCP for scalable deployment. Core architectural patterns such as the Proxy Pattern for request interception and Pipeline Pattern for sequential sanitization ensure modularity and efficiency. This architecture directly supports PRD goals by enabling secure, low-latency threat mitigation (≥90% neutralization, <100ms latency) while maintaining transparency for AI workflows, aligning with the need for resilient agentic AI systems.

### High Level Overview

1. **Main Architectural Style:** Proxy-based architecture, where the sanitizer acts as an in-line intermediary to intercept and sanitize data flows between MCP servers and LLMs.
2. **Repository Structure:** Monorepo, as specified in the PRD, organizing the sanitizer agent, API endpoints, and integration modules under a single repository for simplicity in the prototype.
3. **Service Architecture:** Proxy-based, with modular components for each sanitization step (e.g., normalization, stripping, validation) to enable easy maintenance and extension.
4. **Primary User Interaction Flow:** Requests from n8n or direct API calls enter the proxy → undergo bidirectional sanitization pipeline → validated for provenance → forwarded to LLMs/MCP servers → responses sanitized and returned.
5. **Key Architectural Decisions and Rationale:** Chose proxy style for non-intrusive security layer, fitting the PRD's backend-only focus; monorepo for MVP simplicity; modular services for scalability; prioritized low-latency pipeline to meet NFRs (<5% overhead).

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** Azure Bicep 0.22.6
- **Location:** `infrastructure/azure-bicep`
- **Approach:** Declarative templates for Azure resources (Functions, Storage, etc.)

### Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### Environments

- **dev:** Development environment for testing - Local or Azure free tier
- **staging:** Pre-production for integration testing - Azure with limited resources
- **prod:** Production environment - Full Azure setup with monitoring

### Environment Promotion Flow

dev -> staging -> prod (automated via CI/CD on successful tests)

### Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** Quick rollback to previous deployment version via Azure portal or CLI
- **Trigger Conditions:** Failed health checks or high error rates
- **Recovery Time Objective:** <5 minutes for critical issues

## Error Handling Strategy

### General Approach

- **Error Model:** Custom error classes extending base Error
- **Exception Hierarchy:** SanitizationError, ValidationError, ProvenanceError
- **Error Propagation:** Bubble up with added context, avoid swallowing errors

### Logging Standards

- **Library:** Winston 3.11.0
- **Format:** JSON for structured logging
- **Levels:** error (failures), warn (degraded), info (milestones), debug (detailed)
- **Required Context:**
  - Correlation ID: UUID from request
  - Service Context: Component name and version
  - User Context: Request source (e.g., n8n)

### Error Patterns

#### External API Errors

- **Retry Policy:** Exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
- **Circuit Breaker:** Open after 3 failures, half-open after 60s
- **Timeout Configuration:** 30 seconds for LLM calls
- **Error Translation:** Map external errors to custom SanitizationError

#### Business Logic Errors

- **Custom Exceptions:** InvalidDataError for bad input
- **User-Facing Errors:** Sanitized messages without sensitive data
- **Error Codes:** SAN-001 for sanitization failures

#### Data Consistency

- **Transaction Strategy:** N/A for embedded SQLite
- **Compensation Logic:** Log error and alert on failure
- **Idempotency:** Use request ID to detect duplicates

## Coding Standards

### Core Standards

- **Languages & Runtimes:** Node.js 20.11.0
- **Style & Linting:** ESLint with standard config
- **Test Organization:** Tests in **tests** folder, named \*.test.js

### Naming Conventions

| Element   | Convention       | Example              |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Variables | camelCase        | sanitizedData        |
| Functions | camelCase        | normalizeUnicode     |
| Classes   | PascalCase       | SanitizationPipeline |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS   |

### Critical Rules

- **No console.log in production:** Use Winston logger for all output
- **All API responses must use ApiResponse wrapper:** Standardize response format
- **Database queries must use repository pattern:** Never direct SQLite access

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Node.js Specifics

- **Async/Await:** Use for all async operations, avoid callbacks
- **Error Handling:** Always catch and log errors in async functions

### Risk Assessment

- **Top 5 Risks by Severity:**
  1. Azure dependency lock-in (Medium): Mitigation: Document migration path.
  2. High-throughput scaling (Medium): Mitigation: Monitor and add horizontal scaling.
  3. Evolving obfuscation techniques (Medium): Mitigation: Modular pipeline for updates.
  4. SQLite performance at scale (Low): Mitigation: Migrate to external DB if needed.
  5. API rate limiting conflicts with n8n (Low): Mitigation: Configurable limits.

### Recommendations

- **Must-fix:** None - architecture is solid.
- **Should-fix:** Add more detailed API examples in OpenAPI spec.
- **Nice-to-have:** Expand on scalability plans for high-throughput scenarios.

### AI Implementation Readiness

- Specific concerns: None major; architecture is AI-agent friendly with clear modularity.
- Areas needing clarification: None.
- Complexity hotspots: Sanitization pipeline logic - ensure step-by-step implementation.

### Frontend-Specific Assessment

- Skipped: Backend-only project.

## Next Steps

### Architect Prompt

As architect, review the PRD and create the system architecture document using this as input. Focus on proxy-based design for obfuscation-aware sanitization, with Node.js, Azure, and modular pipeline.
