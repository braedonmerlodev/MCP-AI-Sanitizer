- Story 1.12: QA sign-off and validation
- Story 1.12.6: Documentation and handover

## Key Security Enhancements

- Enhanced input validation and sanitization
- Improved authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Secure secrets management
- API security hardening
- Data encryption and protection
- Dependency vulnerability management
- Comprehensive security testing integration

## Validation Results

- All unit and integration tests passing
- Security vulnerability assessment completed
- Test coverage metrics achieved
- Linting and code quality standards met
- End-to-end testing successful

## Risk Assessment

All identified security risks have been mitigated. The system is now resilient against common attack vectors including injection attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.

## Recommendations
