# Lessons Learned and Future Security Maintenance Procedures

## Lessons Learned

1. **Early Security Integration**: Integrating security controls from the beginning of development cycles prevents costly rework.

2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Security testing must be automated and integrated into CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.

3. **Documentation Importance**: Maintaining up-to-date security documentation ensures knowledge transfer and compliance.

4. **Team Collaboration**: Cross-functional collaboration between development, QA, and security teams is essential for effective security hardening.

5. **Modular Design**: Security controls implemented as modular components allow for easier maintenance and updates.
