## Risk Assessment

- **Top 5 Risks by Severity:**
  1. Azure dependency lock-in (Medium): Mitigation: Document migration path.
  2. High-throughput scaling (Medium): Mitigation: Monitor and add horizontal scaling.
  3. Evolving obfuscation techniques (Medium): Mitigation: Modular pipeline for updates.
  4. SQLite performance at scale (Low): Mitigation: Migrate to external DB if needed.
  5. API rate limiting conflicts with n8n (Low): Mitigation: Configurable limits.

## Recommendations

- **Must-fix:** None - architecture is solid.
- **Should-fix:** Add more detailed API examples in OpenAPI spec.
- **Nice-to-have:** Expand on scalability plans for high-throughput scenarios.

## AI Implementation Readiness

- Specific concerns: None major; architecture is AI-agent friendly with clear modularity.
- Areas needing clarification: None.
- Complexity hotspots: Sanitization pipeline logic - ensure step-by-step implementation.

## Frontend-Specific Assessment

- Skipped: Backend-only project.
