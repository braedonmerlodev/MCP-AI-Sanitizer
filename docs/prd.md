# Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Strengthen trust boundaries in agentic AI systems by providing a reliable security layer that prevents manipulation and data exfiltration.
- Mitigate risks from malicious MCP servers and trojanized LLMs through proactive sanitization and validation.
- Establish a blueprint for resilient agentic AI architectures that can be adopted across industries for long-term security.

### Background Context

In the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic AI, systems increasingly rely on Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced functionality. However, a critical vulnerability has emerged: insider threats from malicious MCP servers and trojanized LLMs, which are distributed as "open source" or with unsafe defaults. These compromised components exploit their trusted access to manipulate agents, exfiltrate sensitive data, or inject hidden instructions, often using sophisticated obfuscation techniques such as Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, and ANSI escape sequences to evade detection. Unlike user-input-based prompt injection attacks, these threats are embedded within the system itself, creating poisoned environments where developers unknowingly route requests through attacker-controlled endpoints.

The proposed solution is the development of an Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent, functioning as an in-line proxy that sits between MCP servers and LLMs within agentic AI systems. The core approach involves a multi-layered sanitization pipeline that normalizes Unicode characters, strips zero-width and non-printing symbols, neutralizes ANSI escape codes, and redacts sensitive patterns before responses are consumed or forwarded. Additionally, it validates data provenance, audits system defaults, and ensures bidirectional sanitization of data flows to intercept hidden instructions and adversarial payloads. Key differentiators include its focus on system-embedded threats (unlike traditional prompt injection defenses) and its ability to provide real-time, transparent security without disrupting AI functionality.

FR5: Enable bidirectional data sanitization for both inputs to and outputs from MCP servers and LLMs to intercept hidden instructions and adversarial payloads.

FR6: Provide backend API endpoints that allow seamless integration with n8n for calling agentic AI systems, with the sanitizer operating transparently.

### Non Functional

NFR1: Achieve a threat neutralization rate of ≥90% for detected obfuscation techniques such as Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, and escape sequences in live interactions.

NFR2: Maintain detection and sanitization latency of <100ms per interaction to minimize performance impact on AI workflows.

NFR4: Support high-throughput data flows of at least 100 requests per second in agentic AI environments without compromising security.

NFR5: Validate data provenance and maintain audit logs for all sanitization actions to ensure transparency and compliance.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

Monorepo: Organize the sanitizer agent, API endpoints, and integration modules under a single repository for simplicity in the prototype.

### Service Architecture

Proxy-based architecture where the sanitizer acts as an intermediary layer between MCP servers and LLMs, with modular components for each sanitization step (e.g., normalization, stripping, validation).

### Testing Requirements

Unit + Integration: Include unit tests for individual sanitization functions and integration tests for end-to-end data flows, ensuring comprehensive coverage without full e2e for MVP.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- Backend language: Node.js or Python for API endpoints and sanitization pipeline, leveraging libraries for Unicode normalization and pattern matching.
- Hosting: Cloud-based (e.g., AWS or GCP) for scalability, with containerization (Docker) for easy deployment.
- Security: Built-in features like encrypted data handling and audit logging; no external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities.
- Performance: Low-latency processing to avoid disrupting AI response times.
