# Data Governance and Audit Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the data governance framework for the Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent, ensuring strict quality, auditability, and security standards for all processed content.

## Data Integrity Framework

### Core Components

1. **Schema Validation**: Ensures data conforms to expected formats and types
2. **Referential Integrity**: Validates relationships between data entities
3. **Cryptographic Lineage**: Maintains tamper-proof links between raw and sanitized data
4. **Atomic Operations**: Guarantees all-or-nothing data processing
5. **Read-Only Access Control**: Prevents unauthorized modifications to sanitized data
6. **Error Routing**: Manages validation failures and manual review processes
7. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all data operations

### Data Models

#### ValidationResult

Records the outcome of integrity validation checks:

- Validation type and status
- Detailed error information
- Associated hash references
- Timestamps and metadata

#### ErrorQueue

Manages records that failed validation:

- Error categorization and prioritization
- Retry mechanisms and status tracking
- Resolution workflows

#### AuditLog

Comprehensive audit trail:

- User actions and system events
- Access patterns and security events
- Data lineage and transformation tracking

#### HashReference

Cryptographic linkage between data states:

- SHA-256 hashes of raw and sanitized data
- Algorithm and timestamp information
- Tamper-proof verification capabilities

## Governance Policies

### Data Quality Standards

1. **Schema Compliance**: All data must validate against defined schemas
2. **Referential Integrity**: Relationships must be maintained and verifiable
3. **Null Value Prevention**: Critical fields cannot contain null values
4. **Type Safety**: Data types must match expected formats

### Security Controls

1. **Access Control**: Role-based access with read-only enforcement
2. **Audit Trails**: All operations are logged and tamper-proof
3. **Data Isolation**: Raw data is segregated from sanitized data
4. **Cryptographic Protection**: Hash-based integrity verification

### Operational Procedures

#### Data Processing Workflow

1. **Input Validation**: Pre-processing schema and referential checks
2. **Sanitization**: Apply security transformations
3. **Post-Processing Validation**: Ensure output integrity
4. **Hash Generation**: Create cryptographic lineage
5. **Audit Logging**: Record all operations
6. **Error Handling**: Route failures for review

#### Error Management

1. **Categorization**: Errors classified by type and severity
2. **Queuing**: Failed records queued for manual review
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
4. **Escalation**: Critical errors trigger alerts
5. **Resolution**: Manual review and correction processes

#### Access Management

1. **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required
2. **Authorization**: Role-based permissions
3. **Audit**: All access attempts logged
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time access pattern analysis

## Audit Procedures

### Regular Audits

#### Daily Checks

- Validation success rates
- Error queue status
- Access log review
- Performance metrics

#### Weekly Reviews

- Data quality trends
- Security incident analysis
- System performance evaluation
- Compliance verification

#### Monthly Assessments

- Comprehensive data integrity audit
- Access control effectiveness review
- Process improvement identification
- Regulatory compliance validation

### Incident Response

#### Data Integrity Violations

1. Immediate isolation of affected data
2. Root cause analysis
3. Corrective action implementation
4. Preventive measure deployment
5. Incident documentation and reporting

#### Security Breaches

1. System isolation and containment
2. Forensic analysis
3. Stakeholder notification
4. Recovery and restoration
5. Post-incident review and improvements

### Reporting

#### Operational Reports

- Daily validation statistics
- Error rates and trends
- System performance metrics
- Access patterns and anomalies

#### Compliance Reports

- Data governance compliance status
- Audit trail completeness
- Security control effectiveness
- Regulatory requirement adherence

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Requirements

1. **Data Protection**: GDPR, CCPA compliance
2. **Security Standards**: ISO 27001 alignment
3. **Audit Requirements**: SOX, PCI DSS compliance
4. **Industry Standards**: NIST, OWASP guidelines

### Quality Assurance

1. **Test Coverage**: 90%+ code and data path coverage
2. **Validation Accuracy**: 99.9% validation success rate
3. **Performance Standards**: <100ms validation latency
4. **Error Rates**: <0.1% false positive/negative rates

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Framework Updates

1. **Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible schema updates
2. **Validation Rules**: Regular rule review and updates
3. **Security Enhancements**: Continuous security improvement
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ongoing efficiency improvements

### Training and Awareness

1. **Staff Training**: Regular governance training
2. **Process Documentation**: Updated procedure manuals
3. **Tool Proficiency**: System usage training
4. **Compliance Awareness**: Regulatory requirement education

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
