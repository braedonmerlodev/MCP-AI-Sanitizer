# Epic 4 Document Ingestion & Sanitization Pipeline

This epic creates a secure document processing system that ingests PDF documents using Microsoft's markitdown library, sanitizes all extracted content through the existing sanitization API, and maintains a validated document library. It ensures AI agents can only access verified, sanitized data by implementing access controls and validation checks. The goal is to provide a trusted knowledge base for agentic AI systems while maintaining the security guarantees of the sanitization pipeline.

## Story 4.1 Implement Document Ingestion with Markitdown

As a content curator, I want to upload PDF documents and have them automatically processed using markitdown, so that document content can be extracted and prepared for sanitization.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Microsoft markitdown library is integrated and configured for PDF processing.
2: Document upload API endpoint accepts PDF files with proper validation.
3: Text content is successfully extracted from uploaded PDF documents.
4: Document metadata (filename, upload date, file size) is captured and stored.

## Story 4.2 Build Sanitized Document Library

As a security officer, I want all ingested document content to be automatically sanitized and stored in a verified library, so that only clean, validated data is available for agent consumption.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Extracted document content is processed through the `/api/sanitize` endpoint.
2: Sanitized documents are stored separately from raw uploads with version tracking.
3: Document status tracking shows sanitization state (pending, processing, completed, failed).
4: API endpoints provide access to sanitized document content and metadata.

## Story 4.3 Agent Data Validation & Access Control

As an AI agent developer, I want to ensure agents can only access validated and sanitized documents, so that all agent interactions use verified, secure data sources.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Validation middleware checks document sanitization status before allowing access.
2: Agents are restricted to accessing only documents marked as sanitized and validated.
3: Audit logging captures all document access attempts and validation checks.
4: Clear error messages guide users when attempting to access unvalidated documents.
