# Requirements

## Functional

FR1: Implement Unicode character normalization in the proxy sanitizer to handle homoglyphs and similar obfuscation techniques.

FR2: Strip zero-width and non-printing symbols from data flows to prevent hidden instructions.

FR3: Neutralize ANSI escape codes and other control sequences in inputs and outputs.

FR4: Enable redaction of sensitive patterns (e.g., API keys, personal data) before forwarding responses.

FR5: Enable bidirectional data sanitization for both inputs to and outputs from MCP servers and LLMs to intercept hidden instructions and adversarial payloads.

FR6: Provide backend API endpoints that allow seamless integration with n8n for calling agentic AI systems, with the sanitizer operating transparently.

## Non Functional

NFR1: Achieve a threat neutralization rate of â‰¥90% for detected obfuscation techniques such as Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, and escape sequences in live interactions.

NFR2: Maintain detection and sanitization latency of <100ms per interaction to minimize performance impact on AI workflows.

NFR3: Ensure sanitization introduces <5% performance overhead on AI responses in production.

NFR4: Support high-throughput data flows of at least 100 requests per second in agentic AI environments without compromising security.

NFR5: Validate data provenance and maintain audit logs for all sanitization actions to ensure transparency and compliance.
