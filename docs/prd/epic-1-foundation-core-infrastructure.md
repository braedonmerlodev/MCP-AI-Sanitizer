# Epic 1 Foundation & Core Infrastructure

This epic establishes the foundational project infrastructure, including cloud deployment, basic API structure, and initial sanitization capabilities. It delivers a deployable base that enables secure AI integrations by setting up the proxy environment and core services. The goal is to provide a stable platform for subsequent epics, ensuring the sanitizer can handle basic data flows while laying groundwork for advanced features.

## Story 1.1 Setup Project Repository and Dependencies

As an AI developer, I want a properly configured monorepo with all necessary dependencies installed, so that development can begin without setup delays.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Repository is initialized with Node.js/Python project structure and package management.
2: Core dependencies for API endpoints (e.g., Express/FastAPI) and Unicode handling are installed.
3: Basic CI/CD pipeline is configured for automated builds and deployments.
4: Documentation for setup is included in the repo.

## Story 1.2 Deploy Cloud Hosting Infrastructure

As a developer, I want the application hosted on a cloud platform with containerization, so that it can be accessed via open API endpoints reliably.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Cloud account (AWS/GCP) is set up with free-tier resources.
2: Docker containerization is implemented for the application.
3: Basic API endpoint is deployed and accessible via HTTPS.
4: Monitoring for uptime and basic logs is configured.

## Story 1.3 Implement Basic Proxy and API Endpoints

As an n8n user, I want basic API endpoints that can receive and forward requests, so that initial integrations can be tested.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Proxy middleware is implemented to intercept requests between MCP/LLM.
2: RESTful endpoints are created for input/output handling.
3: Basic request forwarding works without sanitization.
4: Error handling for invalid requests is included.

## Story 1.4 Add Initial Sanitization for Unicode Normalization

As a security-focused user, I want basic Unicode normalization applied to inputs, so that homoglyph threats are mitigated from the start.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Unicode normalization (NFC/NFKC) is applied to all incoming data.
2: Unit tests verify normalization of common homoglyphs.
3: Performance impact is measured and stays under 5% overhead.
4: Logs record normalization actions for auditing.
