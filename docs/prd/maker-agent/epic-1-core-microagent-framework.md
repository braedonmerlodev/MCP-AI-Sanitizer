# Epic 1: BMAD Builder MAKER Setup

Set up BMAD Builder (bmb/) for creating custom MAKER agents. This epic establishes the foundation by configuring bmb for microagent creation and MAKER principle implementation.

## Story 1.1: BMB Installation and Configuration

As a developer, I want to install and configure BMAD Builder for MAKER agent creation, so that I can build custom agents with voting and red-flagging.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Install bmb/ module in the project
2. Configure bmb/ for MAKER-specific agent templates
3. Set up agent creation workflows in bmb/
4. Validate bmb/ integration with existing BMAD core

## Story 1.2: MAKER Agent Template Design

As a developer, I want to design MAKER agent templates in bmb/, so that new agents automatically include microagent, voting, and red-flagging capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Create MAKER base template in bmb/templates/
2. Define microagent interface standards
3. Include voting consensus logic templates
4. Add red-flagging detection templates

## Story 1.3: Agent Creation Workflow Setup

As a developer, I want to set up workflows in bmb/ for creating MAKER agents, so that the process is streamlined and repeatable.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Configure bmb/ workflows for MAKER agent generation
2. Create validation workflows for new agents
3. Set up testing integration for created agents
4. Document agent creation process
