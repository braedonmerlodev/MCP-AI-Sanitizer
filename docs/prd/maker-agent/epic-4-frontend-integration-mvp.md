# Epic 4: MAKER PDF Agent Creation MVP

Create MAKER-enabled PDF processing agents using BMAD Builder (bmb/) to demonstrate zero-error GPT processing.

## Story 4.1: PDF Processing Agent in BMB

As a developer, I want to create PDF processing agents using bmb/, so that GPT text-to-JSON conversion is MAKER-enhanced.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Build PDF agent using bmb/ templates
2. Implement microagent decomposition for PDF content
3. Integrate voting for JSON validation
4. Add red-flagging for GPT hallucinations

## Story 4.2: MAKER Pipeline Orchestration

As a developer, I want to create orchestration agents with bmb/, so that the complete PDF pipeline uses MAKER principles.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Build pipeline orchestrator agent in bmb/
2. Coordinate sanitization, GPT processing, and MAKER validation
3. Implement end-to-end error recovery
4. Ensure zero-error pipeline execution

## Story 4.3: PDF MAKER System Testing

As a developer, I want to test the complete MAKER PDF system created with bmb/, so that the MVP demonstrates zero-error processing.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Test full PDF processing pipeline with MAKER agents
2. Validate JSON output accuracy and consistency
3. Measure error reduction compared to non-MAKER processing
4. Document MVP capabilities and limitations
