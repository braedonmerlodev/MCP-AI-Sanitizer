# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

A seamless, error-free frontend experience where users interact with AI capabilities that "just work" - no corrupted outputs, no inconsistent behaviors, and automatic error recovery that users never see.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Microagent Orchestration**: Users trigger complex operations that are invisibly decomposed and validated
- **Error-Free Interactions**: All AI responses are pre-validated through voting, ensuring reliability
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple operations work immediately, complex ones scale through microagent networks

## Core Screens and Views

- Agent Configuration Dashboard
- Task Decomposition Visualizer
- Voting Consensus Monitor
- Error Recovery Status Panel

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all agent interactions.

## Branding

Clean, technical aesthetic emphasizing reliability and precision - circuit board motifs, status indicators, and progress visualizations.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on modern web browsers with responsive design for desktop and mobile.
