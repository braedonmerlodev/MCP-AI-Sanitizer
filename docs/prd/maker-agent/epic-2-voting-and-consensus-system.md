# Epic 2: MAKER Voting Agent Creation

Create dedicated voting consensus agents using BMAD Builder (bmb/) for MAKER error correction.

## Story 2.1: Voting Agent Template in BMB

As a developer, I want to create voting agent templates in bmb/, so that consensus logic can be applied to any task.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Design voting agent template in bmb/templates/
2. Implement First-to-Ahead-by-K algorithm
3. Create configurable consensus thresholds
4. Include parallel execution capabilities

## Story 2.2: Consensus State Management Agent

As a developer, I want to build an agent for managing voting state, so that consensus can be tracked across multiple agents.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Create state management agent using bmb/
2. Implement voting result persistence
3. Handle agent failure scenarios
4. Provide real-time consensus updates

## Story 2.3: Voting Integration Testing

As a developer, I want to test voting agents created with bmb/, so that consensus mechanisms work reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Create test scenarios for voting agents
2. Validate consensus accuracy
3. Test parallel agent execution
4. Measure voting performance metrics
