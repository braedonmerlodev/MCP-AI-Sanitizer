# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Implement a frontend agent architecture based on MAKER principles for reliable, scalable AI interactions
- Achieve zero-error task completion through microagent decomposition and voting mechanisms
- Enable exponential scaling of AI capabilities without requiring large, expensive models
- Deliver a working MVP demonstrating MAKER principles in under 4 weeks
- Create a paradigm shift from single "smart" agents to many simple microagents with error correction

## Background Context

Traditional AI scaling focuses on making language models bigger and smarter, but MAKER introduces a revolutionary approach: extreme task decomposition into microagents combined with multi-agent error correction. This solves the million-step LLM problem with zero errors using small, non-reasoning models. For frontend development, this means replacing complex monolithic agents with networks of tiny, focused microagents that validate each other's work through voting and automatically discard corrupted outputs.
