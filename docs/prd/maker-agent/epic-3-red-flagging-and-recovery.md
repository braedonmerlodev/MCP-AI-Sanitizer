# Epic 3: MAKER Red-Flagging Agent Creation

Create red-flagging agents using BMAD Builder (bmb/) for automatic error detection and recovery.

## Story 3.1: Red-Flagging Agent Template

As a developer, I want to create red-flagging agent templates in bmb/, so that errors can be automatically detected in any process.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Design red-flagging agent template in bmb/templates/
2. Implement error pattern detection logic
3. Create configurable red-flag criteria
4. Include automatic recovery triggers

## Story 3.2: Recovery Agent Creation

As a developer, I want to build recovery agents using bmb/, so that red-flagged tasks can be automatically corrected.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Create recovery agent template in bmb/
2. Implement fallback strategy logic
3. Handle different error types appropriately
4. Maintain task continuity during recovery

## Story 3.3: Red-Flagging System Testing

As a developer, I want to test red-flagging agents created with bmb/, so that error detection works accurately.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Create test scenarios for red-flagging agents
2. Validate error detection accuracy
3. Test recovery mechanisms
4. Measure system reliability improvements
