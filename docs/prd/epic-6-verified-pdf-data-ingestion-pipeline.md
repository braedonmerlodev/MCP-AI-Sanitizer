# Epic 6: Verified PDF Data Ingestion Pipeline - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create a comprehensive PDF processing and sanitization system that ensures AI agents can only access verified, sanitized document content. The pipeline ingests raw PDFs, extracts text content, converts to structured Markdown, sanitizes through the existing API, generates clean validated PDFs, and implements strict access controls with trust token integration.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** PDF upload endpoint exists (/api/documents/upload), basic sanitization pipeline implemented, trust token system being developed
- **Technology stack:** Node.js, Express.js, pdf-parse, PDFKit, existing sanitization components
- **Integration points:** API endpoints, sanitization pipeline, document processing workflows

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:**
  - Complete PDF text extraction using pdf-parse
  - Markdown conversion and structuring
  - Integration with /api/sanitize endpoint
  - Clean PDF generation using PDFKit
  - Trust token integration for all processed documents
  - Strict validation and access controls for AI agents

- **How it integrates:** Builds on existing upload endpoint and sanitization pipeline, extends with full processing pipeline and trust token validation

- **Success criteria:**
  - Raw PDFs ingested and fully processed
  - Text extracted reliably from all PDF types
  - Content converted to structured Markdown
  - All content sanitized through existing pipeline
  - Clean PDFs generated with trust tokens
  - AI agents constrained to verified data only
  - Comprehensive validation at each step

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Text Extraction Enhancement

- Extend upload endpoint with pdf-parse integration
- Handle various PDF formats and encodings
- Capture comprehensive metadata

#### Phase 2: Markdown Conversion

- Convert extracted text to structured Markdown
- Preserve document structure (headings, lists, tables)
- Handle formatting and layout preservation

#### Phase 3: Sanitization Integration

- Route Markdown content through /api/sanitize
- Apply conditional sanitization based on LLM destination
- Generate trust tokens for sanitized content

#### Phase 4: Clean PDF Generation

- Use PDFKit to generate validated clean PDFs
- Include trust token metadata
- Ensure output quality and formatting

#### Phase 5: Validation and Access Control

- Implement strict agent access controls
- Validate trust tokens for all document access
- Audit logging of validation attempts

## Stories

1. **PDF Text Extraction Enhancement:** Extend the upload system to fully extract text from PDFs using pdf-parse, handling various formats and capturing metadata.

2. **Markdown Conversion and Structuring:** Convert extracted PDF text to structured Markdown format, preserving document hierarchy and formatting.

3. **Sanitization Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the Markdown content with the /api/sanitize endpoint, applying trust token generation.

4. **Clean PDF Generation:** Use PDFKit to generate validated, clean PDFs from sanitized content with embedded trust tokens.

5. **Agent Validation and Access Control:** Implement strict validation controls ensuring AI agents only access fully verified and sanitized documents.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (backward compatible)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable for document processing

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** PDF processing failures could interrupt document workflows
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive error handling, fallback mechanisms, validation at each step
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to basic upload functionality without full processing pipeline

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Trust token system fully integrated
- [ ] AI agents constrained to verified data
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline tested with various PDF types
