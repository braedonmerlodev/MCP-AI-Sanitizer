# Epic 4 Verified PDF Data Ingestion Pipeline

This epic creates a comprehensive PDF processing and sanitization system that ensures AI agents can only access verified, sanitized document content. The pipeline ingests raw PDFs, extracts text content, converts to structured Markdown, sanitizes through the existing API, generates clean validated PDFs, and implements strict access controls. The goal is to provide a trusted document processing system where all content is verified safe for AI consumption, preventing prompt injection and ensuring data integrity.

## Story 4.1 PDF Ingestion and Text Extraction

As a content curator, I want to upload PDF documents and have their text content reliably extracted, so that the raw document data can be processed for sanitization.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: POST `/api/documents/upload` endpoint accepts PDF file uploads with proper validation.
2: File validation ensures only PDF files are accepted (MIME type, file extension, magic bytes).
3: File size limits are enforced (configurable, default 25MB per document).
4: pdf-parse library successfully extracts text content from uploaded PDFs.
5: Document metadata is captured (filename, upload timestamp, file size, page count, PDF version).
6: Error handling for corrupted PDFs, password-protected files, and extraction failures.
7: Progress tracking and status updates during processing.

## Story 4.2 Markdown Conversion and Structuring

As a data processor, I want extracted PDF text to be converted into well-structured Markdown, so that document formatting and hierarchy are preserved for AI consumption.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Text extraction output is converted to clean Markdown format.
2: Document structure is preserved (headings, paragraphs, lists where detectable).
3: Special characters and formatting are properly escaped for Markdown compatibility.
4: Page breaks and document sections are clearly marked in Markdown.
5: Metadata is embedded as frontmatter in the Markdown document.
6: Conversion process handles various PDF layouts and text encodings.
7: Output validation ensures Markdown syntax is valid and readable.

## Story 4.3 Content Sanitization Integration

As a security officer, I want all Markdown content to be automatically sanitized through the existing API, so that malicious content is neutralized before storage.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Markdown content is sent to `/api/sanitize` endpoint for processing.
2: Sanitization results are captured and validated for success.
3: Failed sanitization attempts are logged and flagged for review.
4: Sanitization metadata is recorded (processing time, changes made, warnings).
5: Integration handles API errors gracefully with retry logic.
6: Performance monitoring tracks sanitization latency and success rates.
7: Audit trail maintains complete processing history.

## Story 4.4 Clean Document Generation

As a document manager, I want sanitized content to be converted back into clean, validated PDF documents, so that a verified document library is maintained.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: PDFKit library generates new PDFs from sanitized Markdown content.
2: Clean PDFs maintain document structure and readability.
3: Watermark or metadata indicates document has been sanitized and verified.
4: File naming convention clearly identifies sanitized documents.
5: Storage system organizes clean documents separately from raw uploads.
6: PDF generation handles various content types and lengths.
7: Quality validation ensures generated PDFs are readable and complete.

## Story 4.5 Agent Validation and Access Control

As an AI agent developer, I want strict validation that ensures agents can only access sanitized and verified documents, so that all AI interactions use trusted, safe data sources.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Document validation system tracks sanitization and verification status.
2: API middleware blocks access to non-verified documents.
3: Agent requests include validation tokens or certificates.
4: Comprehensive audit logging captures all document access attempts.
5: Clear error messages guide developers when validation fails.
6: Access control system supports different permission levels.
7: Validation status is real-time and automatically updated.
