# Epic 3 Integration & Validation

This epic completes the product by adding seamless n8n integration, provenance validation, comprehensive logging, and thorough testing. It delivers a production-ready sanitizer agent that integrates effortlessly with agentic AI workflows, validates data integrity, and ensures reliability through testing. The goal is to provide a fully validated, deployable solution that meets all MVP criteria, enabling users to adopt the blueprint for secure AI architectures.

## Story 3.1 Implement n8n-Compatible API Endpoints

As an n8n user, I want dedicated endpoints for calling agentic AI through the sanitizer, so that integrations are transparent and secure.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Endpoints support n8n's webhook and API calling patterns.
2: Sanitization is applied automatically to all n8n requests/responses.
3: Documentation includes n8n integration examples.
4: End-to-end tests confirm seamless n8n workflows.

## Story 3.2 Add Provenance Validation and Audit Logging

As a compliance officer, I want data provenance validated and full audit logs maintained, so that system integrity is assured and breaches traceable.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Provenance checks verify data origins and defaults.
2: Comprehensive audit logs record all sanitization actions and decisions.
3: Logs are encrypted and accessible for review.
4: Alerts trigger on provenance failures.

## Story 3.3 Conduct Comprehensive Testing and Validation

As a QA team member, I want unit, integration, and performance tests run to validate the entire system, so that the MVP meets success criteria.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Unit tests achieve 90%+ coverage on sanitization functions.
2: Integration tests verify threat neutralization â‰¥90% and latency <100ms.
3: Performance tests confirm <5% overhead and 100 RPS throughput.
4: All tests pass before deployment.
