# Epic 2 Sanitization Pipeline Implementation

This epic develops the core sanitization capabilities, integrating all key pipeline steps for comprehensive threat mitigation. It delivers fully functional obfuscation-aware sanitization that neutralizes Unicode tricks, strips hidden symbols, and redacts patterns in bidirectional flows. The goal is to provide robust security features that protect against insider threats, building directly on the infrastructure from Epic 1 to enable immediate value in AI integrations.

## Story 2.1 Implement Symbol Stripping and Escape Neutralization

As a security user, I want zero-width characters and ANSI escape codes stripped/neutralized from data flows, so that hidden instructions cannot execute.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Zero-width and non-printing symbols are detected and removed from inputs/outputs.
2: ANSI escape sequences are neutralized without altering valid content.
3: Bidirectional processing ensures both directions are sanitized.
4: Unit tests cover edge cases like mixed valid/invalid sequences.

## Story 2.2 Add Pattern Redaction for Sensitive Data

As a privacy-conscious user, I want sensitive patterns (e.g., API keys) redacted before forwarding, so that data exfiltration is prevented.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Configurable regex patterns redact sensitive data in real-time.
2: Redaction preserves data structure without breaking AI responses.
3: Audit logs track redacted items for compliance.
4: Performance remains under 5% overhead with redaction enabled.

## Story 2.3 Integrate Full Bidirectional Sanitization Pipeline

As an AI integrator, I want all sanitization steps combined into a seamless pipeline for inputs and outputs, so that threats are intercepted end-to-end.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Pipeline processes normalization → stripping → neutralization → redaction in order.
2: Bidirectional flows are handled without duplication or errors.
3: Integration tests verify pipeline effectiveness on sample threats.
4: Error recovery ensures sanitization continues on partial failures.
