# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Strengthen trust boundaries in agentic AI systems by providing a reliable security layer that prevents manipulation and data exfiltration.
- Mitigate risks from malicious MCP servers and trojanized LLMs through proactive sanitization and validation.
- Establish a blueprint for resilient agentic AI architectures that can be adopted across industries for long-term security.

## Background Context

In the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic AI, systems increasingly rely on Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced functionality. However, a critical vulnerability has emerged: insider threats from malicious MCP servers and trojanized LLMs, which are distributed as "open source" or with unsafe defaults. These compromised components exploit their trusted access to manipulate agents, exfiltrate sensitive data, or inject hidden instructions, often using sophisticated obfuscation techniques such as Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, and ANSI escape sequences to evade detection. Unlike user-input-based prompt injection attacks, these threats are embedded within the system itself, creating poisoned environments where developers unknowingly route requests through attacker-controlled endpoints.

The proposed solution is the development of an Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent, functioning as an in-line proxy that sits between MCP servers and LLMs within agentic AI systems. The core approach involves a multi-layered sanitization pipeline that normalizes Unicode characters, strips zero-width and non-printing symbols, neutralizes ANSI escape codes, and redacts sensitive patterns before responses are consumed or forwarded. Additionally, it validates data provenance, audits system defaults, and ensures bidirectional sanitization of data flows to intercept hidden instructions and adversarial payloads. Key differentiators include its focus on system-embedded threats (unlike traditional prompt injection defenses) and its ability to provide real-time, transparent security without disrupting AI functionality.
