# Epic 4.2 Sanitized Document Library

This sub-epic builds the core document management system that processes extracted text through the sanitization pipeline and maintains a secure, validated document library. It ensures all document content is properly sanitized before storage and provides APIs for accessing validated documents. The goal is to create a trusted knowledge base where only verified, clean content is available.

## Story 4.2.1 Integrate with Sanitization API

As a security engineer, I want extracted document text to be automatically processed through the sanitization pipeline, so that all content meets security standards.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Integration with existing `/api/sanitize` endpoint is implemented.
2: Document text is sent for sanitization after extraction.
3: Sanitization results are captured and validated.
4: Error handling for sanitization failures preserves data integrity.

## Story 4.2.2 Implement Document Status Tracking

As a system administrator, I want to track the sanitization status of all documents, so that processing progress and issues can be monitored.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Document status system tracks states: uploaded, processing, sanitized, failed.
2: Status updates are logged with timestamps and processing details.
3: API endpoints provide status checking capabilities.
4: Failed sanitization attempts are flagged for manual review.

## Story 4.2.3 Create Sanitized Document Storage

As a data architect, I want sanitized documents stored separately from raw uploads, so that clean content is isolated from potentially malicious input.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Separate storage location for sanitized document content.
2: Document versioning supports multiple sanitization attempts.
3: Storage format preserves document structure and metadata.
4: Access controls prevent direct access to unsanitized content.

## Story 4.2.4 Build Document Retrieval APIs

As an API consumer, I want secure endpoints to access sanitized documents, so that applications can retrieve validated content.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: GET endpoints for retrieving sanitized document content and metadata.
2: Document listing API with filtering and pagination.
3: Content served with appropriate security headers.
4: Rate limiting and access logging implemented.
