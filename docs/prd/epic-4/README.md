# Epic 4: Document Ingestion & Sanitization Pipeline

This directory contains the sharded sub-epics for Epic 4, broken down into focused, manageable components.

## Sub-Epic Structure

### Epic 4.1: Document Ingestion with Markitdown

**File:** `epic-4.1-document-ingestion-markitdown.md`
**Focus:** PDF processing and text extraction capabilities
**Stories:** 4.1.1 - 4.1.4 (Library integration, upload API, text extraction, storage foundation)

### Epic 4.2: Sanitized Document Library

**File:** `epic-4.2-sanitized-document-library.md`
**Focus:** Content sanitization and validated document storage
**Stories:** 4.2.1 - 4.2.4 (API integration, status tracking, sanitized storage, retrieval APIs)

### Epic 4.3: Agent Data Validation & Access Control

**File:** `epic-4.3-agent-data-validation.md`
**Focus:** Security controls and agent access restrictions
**Stories:** 4.3.1 - 4.3.4 (Validation middleware, access controls, audit logging, integration guidelines)

## Implementation Order

1. **Epic 4.1** - Foundation (document ingestion capabilities)
2. **Epic 4.2** - Core functionality (sanitization and storage)
3. **Epic 4.3** - Security layer (access controls and validation)

## Dependencies

- **Epic 4.1** - Independent (can be implemented first)
- **Epic 4.2** - Depends on Epic 4.1 completion
- **Epic 4.3** - Depends on Epic 4.2 completion

## Integration Points

- Uses current logging and error handling patterns
- Follows existing API response formats
- Integrates with Docker containerization

## Success Criteria

- PDF documents can be uploaded and processed
- All content is automatically sanitized
- Agents can only access validated documents
- Comprehensive audit logging is maintained
- System maintains <200ms processing latency
