# Epic 4.1 Document Ingestion with Markitdown

This sub-epic focuses on implementing document ingestion capabilities using Microsoft's markitdown library. It establishes the foundation for processing PDF documents and extracting text content that can be sanitized. The goal is to create a reliable document upload and processing system that integrates seamlessly with the existing sanitization pipeline.

## Story 4.1.1 Integrate Markitdown Library

As a developer, I want the markitdown library properly integrated into the project, so that PDF document processing capabilities are available.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Microsoft markitdown package is added to project dependencies.
2: Library is successfully imported and basic functionality tested.
3: PDF processing functions are wrapped in appropriate error handling.
4: Documentation for markitdown usage is included in the codebase.

## Story 4.1.2 Create Document Upload API

As a content curator, I want a secure API endpoint for uploading PDF documents, so that documents can be submitted for processing.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: POST endpoint `/api/documents/upload` accepts PDF file uploads.
2: File validation ensures only PDF files are accepted (MIME type, file extension).
3: File size limits are enforced (maximum 10MB per document).
4: Upload progress and status responses are provided to clients.

## Story 4.1.3 Implement Text Extraction Pipeline

As a system integrator, I want uploaded PDFs to have their text content automatically extracted, so that the content is ready for sanitization processing.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Markitdown processes uploaded PDFs and extracts text content successfully.
2: Extracted text is stored temporarily for sanitization processing.
3: Document metadata (filename, upload timestamp, file size, page count) is captured.
4: Error handling for corrupted PDFs or extraction failures is implemented.

## Story 4.1.4 Add Document Storage Foundation

As a data manager, I want basic document storage capabilities, so that processed documents can be tracked and managed.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: File system or database storage for uploaded PDF files is implemented.
2: Document metadata is stored with unique identifiers.
3: Basic document retrieval and listing APIs are created.
4: Storage follows security best practices (no executable permissions, proper access controls).
