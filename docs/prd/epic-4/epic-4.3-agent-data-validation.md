# Epic 4.3 Agent Data Validation & Access Control

This sub-epic implements the security controls that ensure AI agents can only access validated, sanitized documents. It creates validation middleware, access control mechanisms, and audit logging to maintain the integrity of the agent knowledge base. The goal is to prevent agents from accessing unverified or malicious content while providing transparent security guarantees.

## Story 4.3.1 Create Document Validation Middleware

As a security architect, I want validation middleware that checks document sanitization status, so that only verified content can be accessed by agents.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Middleware function validates document sanitization status before access.
2: Requests for unsanitized documents are blocked with appropriate error responses.
3: Validation is performed at the API level before data retrieval.
4: Middleware integrates with existing Express.js request pipeline.

## Story 4.3.2 Implement Agent Access Controls

As an agent developer, I want agents restricted to accessing only sanitized documents, so that all agent interactions use verified data sources.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Agent requests include validation tokens or API keys for authentication.
2: Access control logic prevents agents from requesting unsanitized content.
3: Clear error messages guide developers when validation fails.
4: Access patterns are logged for security monitoring.

## Story 4.3.3 Add Comprehensive Audit Logging

As a compliance officer, I want all document access attempts logged with full context, so that security incidents can be investigated and prevented.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: All document access attempts are logged with timestamps and requester details.
2: Failed validation attempts are flagged with security alerts.
3: Audit logs include document IDs, access methods, and sanitization status.
4: Logs are encrypted and stored securely for compliance requirements.

## Story 4.3.4 Create Agent Integration Guidelines

As a DevOps engineer, I want clear documentation and examples for agent integration, so that developers can properly implement secure document access.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: API documentation includes agent integration examples and best practices.
2: Sample code demonstrates proper validation token usage.
3: Error handling patterns for validation failures are documented.
4: Security considerations for agent implementations are covered.
