# Epic 4.5 Agent Validation and Access Control

This sub-epic focuses on implementing strict validation and access control mechanisms that ensure AI agents can only access verified, sanitized documents. It creates a comprehensive security layer with audit logging, validation middleware, and access control that prevents agents from consuming unverified content. The goal is to provide absolute confidence that all AI agent interactions use trusted, sanitized data sources.

As an AI agent developer, I want strict validation that ensures agents can only access sanitized and verified documents, so that all AI interactions use trusted, secure data sources.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Document validation system tracks sanitization and verification status in real-time.
2: API middleware blocks all access attempts to non-verified documents.
3: Agent requests require validation tokens or certificates for authentication.
4: Comprehensive audit logging captures all document access attempts and validation checks.
5: Clear, actionable error messages guide developers when validation fails.
6: Access control system supports role-based permissions and different trust levels.
7: Validation status updates automatically and propagates to all access points.
