# Epic 4.3 Content Sanitization Integration

This sub-epic focuses on integrating the Markdown content with the existing sanitization API. It ensures all document content passes through the security pipeline before being considered safe for storage and AI consumption. The goal is to provide automated sanitization that catches malicious content while maintaining processing reliability and performance.

As a security officer, I want all Markdown content to be automatically sanitized through the existing API, so that malicious content is neutralized before document storage.

Acceptance Criteria:
1: Markdown content is sent to `/api/sanitize` endpoint for processing.
2: Sanitization results are captured and validated for successful completion.
3: Failed sanitization attempts are logged and flagged for manual review.
4: Sanitization metadata is recorded (processing time, changes made, warnings issued).
5: Integration handles API errors gracefully with exponential backoff retry logic.
6: Performance monitoring tracks sanitization latency and success rates.
7: Complete audit trail maintains processing history for compliance.
