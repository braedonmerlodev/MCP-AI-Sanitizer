decision: PASS
rationale: |
  Comprehensive review shows implementation meets all acceptance criteria with strong traceability to Epic 5 requirements. Risk assessment indicates low-medium risk level with effective mitigations in place. Test strategy provides good coverage though additional performance and security testing recommended. Code quality adheres to standards and maintains backward compatibility. Conservative classification defaults ensure security is not compromised.

  Key Findings:
  - Requirements fully traced and implemented
  - Conditional logic correctly bypasses sanitization for non-LLM traffic
  - Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
  - Low risk profile with fallback mechanisms
  - No regressions in existing functionality

  Recommendations for Production:
  - Monitor performance improvements
  - Add security tests for classification bypass scenarios
  - Implement performance benchmarks
