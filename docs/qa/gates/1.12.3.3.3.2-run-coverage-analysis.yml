story_title: 'Run Coverage Analysis and Ensure Test Integration'
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Story has clear validation goals but the 80% coverage target is extremely ambitious given current ~2.8% baseline - may require scope adjustment'

top_issues:
  - id: 'TEST-003'
    severity: high
    finding: '80% function coverage target is extremely ambitious given current ~2.8% baseline - may be unrealistic for this story scope'
    suggested_action: 'Consider breaking into phases or adjusting target based on actual function count and complexity'
  - id: 'TEST-004'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'No specific test execution time limits defined - could lead to performance issues'
    suggested_action: 'Add maximum execution time requirements (e.g., under 5 minutes) to acceptance criteria'
  - id: 'REL-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Story depends entirely on successful completion of previous sub-story - no contingency if tests from 1.12.3.3.3.1 have issues'
    suggested_action: 'Add validation steps to ensure prerequisite tests are working before proceeding'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - 'Assess actual function count in target modules to determine realistic coverage target'
    - 'Add specific test execution time requirements to acceptance criteria'
    - 'Include prerequisite validation steps for tests from previous sub-story'
  future:
    - 'Consider phased approach to coverage improvement across multiple stories if 80% proves unrealistic'</content>
