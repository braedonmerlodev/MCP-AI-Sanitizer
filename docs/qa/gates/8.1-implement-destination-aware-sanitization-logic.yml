story_title: 'Implement Destination-Aware Sanitization Logic'
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Core conditional sanitization logic is implemented and tested, but missing bidirectional response sanitization, destination-aware audit logging, configurable risk mappings, and performance metrics tracking.'
