decision: FAIL
rationale: Multiple critical test failures across security-critical components prevent production deployment. Acceptance criteria for passing tests and 80% coverage not met despite implementation claims.
issues:
  - Trust token validation failures in PDF generator and API endpoints
  - JSON transformer performance regressions exceeding benchmarks
  - API contract violations in sanitization responses
  - E2E async workflow failures with 500 errors
  - Incomplete test coverage due to blocking failures
risk_assessment:
  level: High
  probability_impact: High risk due to security validation failures
  key_risks:
    - Security vulnerabilities from broken trust token logic
    - Production performance issues from transformer regressions
    - API compatibility breaks for consumers
nfr_compliance:
  security: FAIL
  performance: FAIL
  reliability: FAIL
  maintainability: CONCERNS
recommendations:
  - Immediately fix trust token validation logic
  - Address PDF generation validation issues
  - Optimize JSON transformer performance bottlenecks
  - Debug and repair async job processing pipeline
  - Improve test error diagnostics for better debugging
  - Re-run QA review after fixes implemented
