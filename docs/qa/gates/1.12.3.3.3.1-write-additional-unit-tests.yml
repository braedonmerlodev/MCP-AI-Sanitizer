top_issues:
  - id: 'TEST-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Acceptance criteria specify "10-15 additional unit tests" but lack specific function names - could be subjective during implementation'
    suggested_action: 'Consider adding specific function names or create a checklist of target functions during development'
  - id: 'TEST-002'
    severity: low
    finding: 'No specific test execution time or performance requirements mentioned'
    suggested_action: 'Add guidance on expected test execution time to ensure tests are efficient'

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Adding unit tests for security-related modules (TrustTokenGenerator, AccessControlEnforcer) supports security validation'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Unit tests should not impact system performance - focus is on test efficiency'

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Following existing test patterns ensures maintainability'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - 'During implementation, create a detailed list of specific functions being tested to ensure the 10-15 test target is met objectively'
  future:
    - 'Consider adding integration test coverage for complex function interactions in future stories'</content>
