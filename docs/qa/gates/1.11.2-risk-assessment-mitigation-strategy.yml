story: '1.11.2'
story_title: 'Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategy'
gate: PASS
status_reason: 'Comprehensive risk assessment completed with detailed brownfield impact analysis, automated rollback procedures implemented, coverage monitoring infrastructure established, security implications documented, and all test infrastructure dependencies mapped. Mitigation strategies provide robust safeguards for safe coverage improvements in the security hardening environment.'
