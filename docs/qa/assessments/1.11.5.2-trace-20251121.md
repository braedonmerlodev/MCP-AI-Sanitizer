### Critical Gaps

1. **Implementation Status**
   - Gap: Story is in draft status with no implemented functionality
   - Risk: High - Requirements cannot be validated
   - Action: Complete implementation of coverage verification script and npm script

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Gap: No automated tests exist for coverage verification
   - Risk: High - Cannot ensure coverage goals are met
   - Action: Implement comprehensive test suite for coverage verification logic

3. **Current Coverage Levels**
   - Gap: Current coverage is approximately 70-74% across metrics, below 80% target
   - Risk: Medium - May require additional test implementation
   - Action: Analyze coverage gaps and implement additional tests

### Test Design Recommendations

1. Unit tests for coverage verification script logic
2. Integration tests for npm script execution
3. E2E tests for CI/CD pipeline integration
4. Mock data tests for various coverage scenarios

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: All requirements have no test coverage due to draft status
- **Medium Risk**: Current coverage levels below target thresholds
- **Low Risk**: Existing coverage functionality appears stable
