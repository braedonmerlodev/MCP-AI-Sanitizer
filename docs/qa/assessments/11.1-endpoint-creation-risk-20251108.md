## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                    | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Input validation bypass on new endpoint        | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| PERF-001 | Performance targets not met (<100ms, 100+ RPS) | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Trust token generation failure                 | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Medium   |
| TECH-001 | Integration issues with SanitizationPipeline   | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Load testing for 100+ RPS throughput
- Response time benchmarking for <100ms target
- Stress testing under high concurrent requests

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Integration tests for trust token generation
- Security testing for input validation edge cases
- End-to-end API testing for sanitization pipeline integration

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Performance benchmarks must be validated and monitored

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Low risks with compensating controls

### Accepted Risks

None - all risks can be mitigated.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Response time metrics for /api/sanitize/json endpoint
- Throughput monitoring for RPS limits
- Error rates for sanitization failures
- Trust token validation success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Performance issues reported in production
- Security incidents related to sanitization
- API usage patterns change significantly
- New sanitization rules added
