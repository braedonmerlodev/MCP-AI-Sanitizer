### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 3
- Fully Covered: 3 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Test is integrated into CI/CD pipeline and runs automatically on relevant triggers

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **CI/CD Integration Test**: `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yaml::Run tests`
  - Given: Pull request opened or updated targeting main branch
  - When: GitHub Actions CI pipeline executes validation job
  - Then: npm test command runs all tests including end-to-end-pipeline.test.js
  - Coverage: full

#### AC2: Test documentation is added to QA procedures

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Documentation Test**: `docs/qa/procedures.md::End-to-End Pipeline Testing`
  - Given: QA procedures document exists
  - When: Documentation is reviewed for completeness
  - Then: E2E test procedures, execution steps, and validation criteria are documented
  - Coverage: full

#### AC3: No regression in existing functionality verified through test execution in CI

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Regression Test**: `src/tests/integration/end-to-end-pipeline.test.js::Complete Pipeline Flow`
  - Given: End-to-end test suite with mocked dependencies
  - When: Pipeline test executes in CI environment
  - Then: All existing functionality continues to work, no regressions detected
  - Coverage: full

- **CI Test Execution**: `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yaml::Run tests`
  - Given: All test suites including new e2e test
  - When: CI executes npm test command
  - Then: All tests pass, confirming no regressions in existing functionality
  - Coverage: integration

### Test Design Recommendations
