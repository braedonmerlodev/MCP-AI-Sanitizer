## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category    | Title                                                        | Probability | Impact     | Score | Mitigation Strategy                                                        |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TECH-001 | Technical   | Coverage tool integration failure                            | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Run coverage tests separately from regular CI; validate tool compatibility |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Increased test execution time with coverage                  | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Acceptable overhead; monitor execution times in CI/CD                      |
| OPS-001  | Operational | False positive test failures due to coverage instrumentation | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Review test failures manually; ensure proper test isolation                |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None required.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None required.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard integration test execution with coverage
- Regression test suite validation
- Coverage report accuracy verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

All risks are low and acceptable with current mitigations.

### Accepted Risks

- Minor performance impact from coverage collection (accepted as necessary for quality assurance)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Test execution times in CI/CD pipelines
- Coverage report generation success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Coverage tool version changes
- Test infrastructure modifications
- Performance issues with test execution
