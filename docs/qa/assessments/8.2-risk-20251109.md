Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 1
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 85/100 (excellent for optimization story)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Performance: 1 risks (0 critical)

### By Component

- Bidirectional Processing: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                            | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| PERF-001 | Bypass logic overhead might not provide expected gains | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Monitor bypass rates and latency improvements |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None identified.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Performance regression tests for bidirectional processing
- Bypass rate monitoring tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Acceptable with monitoring

### Accepted Risks

- PERF-001: Low impact performance risk

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Bidirectional processing latency
- Bypass rate effectiveness
- Request/response processing consistency</content>
