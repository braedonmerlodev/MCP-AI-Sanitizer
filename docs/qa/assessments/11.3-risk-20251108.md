Date: 2025-11-08
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 61/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Insufficient token validation leading to security bypass

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex validation logic for trust tokens in a security-sensitive feature
**Impact**: High - Could allow unauthorized reuse of sanitized content or bypass security controls
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive token validation including signature, expiration, and content hash matching
- Add security-focused unit and integration tests
- Conduct security review before deployment
  **Testing Focus**: Token tampering scenarios, replay attacks, invalid signature handling

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                              | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Category    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| SEC-001  | Insufficient token validation leading to security bypass | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical | Security    |
| PERF-001 | Performance degradation if reuse logic is inefficient    | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Performance |
| TECH-001 | Integration issues with existing sanitization pipeline   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Technical   |
| DATA-001 | Cached results tampering via hash mismatch               | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Data        |
| OPS-001  | Missing monitoring for reuse effectiveness               | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Low      | Operational |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing for token validation bypass scenarios
- Content hash verification tests
- Replay attack prevention tests
- Integration tests for trust token workflow

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance benchmarks for <10ms target
- Integration tests with existing sanitization pipeline

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard API functional tests
- Monitoring and logging verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- Token validation security controls

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Performance monitoring implementation
- Integration testing completion

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Token validation success/failure rates
- Reuse operation performance metrics
- Security alerts for validation failures
- Cache effectiveness statistics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Token validation logic changes
- Performance requirements evolve
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Implementation begins
