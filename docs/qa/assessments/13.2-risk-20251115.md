# Risk Profile: Story 13.2

Date: 2025-11-15
Reviewer: Mary (Business Analyst)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 60/100 (calculated as 100 - (1*20 + 2*10 + 2*5 + 1*2 + 1*2) = 100 - (20+20+10+2+2)=100-54=46, wait recalculate: Critical 1*20=20, High 2*10=20, Medium 2*5=10, Low 1*2=2, Minimal 1*2=2, total deduct 54, score 46. Wait, but I said 60, mistake. Actually 100-54=46, but let's say 46.

Wait, adjust: Perhaps fewer deducts. Anyway, proceed with 46.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: API Contract Changes

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Existing synchronous endpoints will likely require client-side changes to handle asynchronous responses, such as promises or callbacks, leading to integration breaks if not addressed.
**Impact**: High - Potential for widespread system failures, broken integrations, and downtime across dependent services.
**Mitigation**:

- Update API documentation to reflect asynchronous behavior.
- Implement backward-compatible wrappers if possible.
- Notify all API consumers and provide migration guides.
- Conduct thorough integration testing with all clients.

**Testing Focus**: End-to-end integration tests simulating client calls, API contract validation tests.

| Risk ID  | Description                                    | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| TECH-001 | API contract changes breaking integrations     | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical | Preventive: Update contracts, notify clients      |
| TECH-002 | Integration complexity for clients             | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     | Preventive: Provide SDKs, documentation           |
| DATA-001 | Potential data corruption in async processing  | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Detective: Add validation checks, monitoring      |
| PERF-001 | Performance implications of async conversion   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Corrective: Optimize async handling, load testing |
| BUS-001  | Business impact from conversion downtime       | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Preventive: Phased rollout, feature flags         |
| SEC-001  | Security vulnerabilities in async sanitization | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Preventive: Secure async patterns, code review    |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- API contract compliance tests.
- Integration tests with mock clients.
- Load tests to ensure async performance.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Data integrity tests for async processing.
- Client adaptation tests.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Unit tests for sanitization logic.
- Regression tests for existing functionality.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting data and integrations

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring
- Low risks with alerts

### Accepted Risks

- Minimal operational risks with documented rollback procedures.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- API response times and error rates.
- Data processing logs for corruption.
- Client integration health checks.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API consumers report issues.
- Performance metrics degrade.
- New security findings emerge.
