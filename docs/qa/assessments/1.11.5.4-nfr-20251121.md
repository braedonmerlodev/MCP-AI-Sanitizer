# NFR Assessment: 1.11.5.4

Date: 2025-11-21
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: FAIL - Timing attack vulnerability and information disclosure risks
- Performance: CONCERNS - Timing differences exceed acceptable thresholds
- Reliability: FAIL - 500 internal server errors in API routes
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test suite failures indicate maintainability issues

## Critical Issues

1. **Timing attack vulnerability** (Security)
   - Risk: Information leakage through timing differences
   - Fix: Implement constant-time comparison algorithms

2. **API server errors** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Unreliable API responses with 500 errors
   - Fix: Debug and fix error handling in job status routes

3. **Test suite failures** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Unreliable test suite affects code quality assurance
   - Fix: Resolve failing tests and improve test stability

## Quick Wins

- Fix timing attack: Implement constant-time operations (~2 hours)
- Resolve API errors: Debug job status controller (~4 hours)
- Stabilize test suite: Fix failing test assertions (~3 hours)</content>
