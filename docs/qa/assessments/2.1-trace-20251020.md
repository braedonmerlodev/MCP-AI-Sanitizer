#### AC3: Bidirectional processing ensures both directions are sanitized.

**Coverage: NONE**

No automated tests found for bidirectional processing in the SanitizationPipeline.

### Critical Gaps

1. **Bidirectional Processing Tests**
   - Gap: No automated tests for bidirectional processing in SanitizationPipeline
   - Risk: High - Core requirement not validated
   - Action: Implement integration tests for full pipeline with input/output flows

2. **Integration Test Coverage**
   - Gap: Story mentions integration tests but none found
   - Risk: Medium - Component interaction not tested
   - Action: Create integration tests for SanitizationPipeline

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. Integration tests for SanitizationPipeline covering sequential processing
2. End-to-end tests for bidirectional data flow through API endpoints
3. Performance tests for sanitization speed with large inputs
4. Security tests for bypass attempts with complex sequences

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC3 (bidirectional processing) - no test coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Integration testing gaps
- **Low Risk**: AC1, AC2, AC4 - well covered with unit tests
