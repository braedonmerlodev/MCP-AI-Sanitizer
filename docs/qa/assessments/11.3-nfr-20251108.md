Date: 2025-11-08
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: FAIL - Not implemented
- Performance: FAIL - Not implemented
- Reliability: FAIL - Not implemented
- Maintainability: FAIL - Not implemented

## Critical Issues

1. **Security not implemented** (Security)
   - Risk: Trust token validation missing, potential security vulnerabilities
   - Fix: Implement token validation with signature, expiration, and content hash checks

2. **Performance targets not met** (Performance)
   - Risk: <10ms response time for cached content not achievable
   - Fix: Implement fast-path processing and performance monitoring

3. **Reliability mechanisms missing** (Reliability)
   - Risk: No fallback for invalid tokens, potential service disruption
   - Fix: Add error handling and graceful degradation

4. **No testing or documentation** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Code not testable, hard to maintain
   - Fix: Add comprehensive tests and update documentation

## Quick Wins

- Implement basic token validation: ~4 hours
- Add performance monitoring: ~2 hours
- Create unit tests: ~6 hours
- Update API documentation: ~1 hour
