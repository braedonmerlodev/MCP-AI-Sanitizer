## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001  | Misconfigured risk mappings allow high-risk data bypass | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Input validation, secure defaults, admin training  |
| SEC-002  | Configuration injection via environment variables       | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Environment variable validation, no code execution |
| PERF-001 | Performance metrics collection overhead                 | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Minimal timing operations, async collection        |
| TECH-001 | Silent fallback to defaults on config errors            | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Warning logs, monitoring for fallback usage        |
| OPS-001  | Complex configuration management for administrators     | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      | Documentation, examples, validation feedback       |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Configuration validation tests for invalid mappings
- Integration tests verifying risk-based sanitization bypass
- Security tests for environment variable injection

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- End-to-end configuration loading tests
- Performance regression tests with metrics enabled

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Documentation accuracy tests
- Fallback behavior tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: Misconfigured risk mappings

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001: Silent fallback (acceptable with monitoring)

### Accepted Risks

- PERF-001: Performance overhead (minimal impact)
- OPS-001: Configuration complexity (acceptable for admin feature)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Configuration loading errors
- Fallback to defaults frequency
- Performance metrics accuracy
- Sanitization bypass rates by risk level

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Configuration format changes
- New risk levels added
- Performance issues reported
- Security incidents related to sanitization</content>
