# Project Brief: Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent

## Executive Summary

The Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent is a backend-only sandbox application designed to provide secure API endpoints for integrating with agentic AI systems via n8n. It tackles the growing insider threats posed by malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and trojanized Large Language Models (LLMs), which exploit trusted positions to manipulate agents, exfiltrate data, or embed hidden instructions using obfuscation techniques like Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, and escape sequences. Targeted at AI developers and organizations building resilient agentic systems, this solution delivers a multi-layered sanitization pipeline that normalizes characters, strips non-printing symbols, neutralizes escape codes, and validates provenance in both directions, ultimately strengthening trust boundaries and providing a blueprint for secure AI architectures.

## Problem Statement

In the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic AI, systems increasingly rely on Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced functionality. However, a critical vulnerability has emerged: insider threats from malicious MCP servers and trojanized LLMs, which are distributed as "open source" or with unsafe defaults. These compromised components exploit their trusted access to manipulate agents, exfiltrate sensitive data, or inject hidden instructions, often using sophisticated obfuscation techniques such as Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, and ANSI escape sequences to evade detection. Unlike user-input-based prompt injection attacks, these threats are embedded within the system itself, creating poisoned environments where developers unknowingly route requests through attacker-controlled endpoints. The impact is profound: potential data breaches, operational disruptions, and eroded trust in AI systems, with no current solutions adequately addressing these system-level exposures. The urgency is high, as the proliferation of agentic AI amplifies these risks, necessitating immediate action to develop resilient security layers before widespread adoption leads to irreversible damage.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is the development of an Obfuscation-Aware Sanitizer Agent, functioning as an in-line proxy that sits between MCP servers and LLMs within agentic AI systems. The core approach involves a multi-layered sanitization pipeline that normalizes Unicode characters, strips zero-width and non-printing symbols, neutralizes ANSI escape codes, and redacts sensitive patterns before responses are consumed or forwarded. Additionally, it validates data provenance, audits system defaults, and ensures bidirectional sanitization of data flows to intercept hidden instructions and adversarial payloads. Key differentiators include its focus on system-embedded threats (unlike traditional prompt injection defenses) and its ability to provide real-time, transparent security without disrupting AI functionality. This solution will succeed where others have fallen short by addressing the root cause of poisoned environments, offering a proactive, scalable layer that not only mitigates immediate risks but also establishes a blueprint for building resilient agentic AI architectures, fostering greater trust and adoption in the field.

- **Security/Compliance:** Built-in security features like encrypted data handling, audit logging for provenance, and compliance with standards like OWASP for API security; no external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities.

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints**

- **Budget:** Limited to $5,000-$10,000 for initial development (covering tools, cloud instances, and basic testing), assuming bootstrapped or internal resources; excludes marketing or full-time hires to maintain lean operations.
- **Timeline:** 2 months for MVP delivery, with a focus on delivering one core feature (trojanized MCP mitigation) by the end of month 1, followed by testing and integration in month 2.
- **Resources:** Relies on a small team (1-2 developers with AI/security expertise) plus open-source contributions; limited access to specialized tools, requiring creative use of free libraries.
- **Technical:** Backend-only scope with dependencies on n8n compatibility and no support for multi-cloud deployments, potentially impacting scalability in diverse environments. Scope narrowed to trojanized MCP mitigation only, deferring LLM-related features to future backlog.

**Key Assumptions**

- Open-source libraries for sanitization (e.g., Python's unicodedata for MCP threat handling) are sufficient and license-compatible, reducing development overhead.
- Target users (AI developers) will adopt the blueprint organically through community sharing, assuming security is a growing priority in agentic AI without heavy promotion.
- Technical feasibility is high given standard server setups, with no need for custom hardware; threats evolve predictably based on historical patterns (e.g., similar to prompt injection trends).
- The project aligns with emerging standards (e.g., AI safety guidelines), enabling easier compliance and reducing regulatory hurdles. Focus on MCP mitigation as the sole key feature ensures quick delivery without overextending scope.

## Risks & Open Questions

**Key Risks**

- **Incomplete Threat Mitigation:** The sanitization pipeline may not catch all evolving obfuscation techniques in trojanized MCP servers, leading to undetected manipulations; impact: High (potential data exfiltration in automated calls), mitigated by iterative testing in month 2.
- **Backend Hosting and Automation Issues:** Simple internet-hosted backend may face reliability issues (e.g., downtime or latency) that disrupt sanitization automation; impact: Medium (interrupted AI workflows), mitigated by choosing reliable cloud providers and basic monitoring.
- **Integration Challenges with n8n:** API instability or version conflicts could delay the 2-month timeline for automation; impact: Medium (1-2 week delay), mitigated by early prototyping and fallback to basic REST endpoints.
- **Scope Creep from Deferred Features:** Temptation to add LLM processing could overload the small team; impact: High (timeline overrun), mitigated by strict backlog management and weekly check-ins.

**Open Questions**
